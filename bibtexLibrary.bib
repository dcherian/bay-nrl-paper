It also includes tropical cyclone (TC) management issues like early warning systems, recent high impact TC events, disaster preparedness, assessment of risk and vulnerability including construction, archiving and retrieval of the best tracking and historical data sets, policy decision etc., in view of recent findings on climate change aspects and their impact on TC activity. The chapters are authored by leading experts, both from research and operational environments. This book is relevant to cyclone forecasters and researchers, managers, policy makers, graduate and undergraduate students. It intends to stimulate thinking and hence further research in the field of TCs and climate change, especially over the Indian Ocean region and provides high-quality reference materials for all the users mentioned above for the management of TCs over this region},

Drawing on advice from over twenty books and hundreds of other sources, this volume presents informative and often humorous tips for writing scientific journal articles, while also providing a peek behind the curtain into the operations of editorial boards and publishers of major journals. The volume focuses on writing, reviewing, and speaking and is aimed at the domain of the student or scientist at the start of her career. The volume offers tips on poster presentations, media communication, and advice for non-native speakers of English, as well as appendices on proper punctuation usage and commonly misunderstood meteorological concepts. A further reading section at the end of each chapter suggests additional sources for the interested reader, and sidebars written by experts in the field offer diverse viewpoints on reference topics.--Publisher description},

The impacts may be reduced by adaptation and moderated by mitigation, especially by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. However, global efforts to reduce emissions have not yet been sufficiently successful to provide confidence that the reductions needed to avoid dangerous climate change will be achieved. This has led to growing interest in geoengineering, defined here as the deliberate large-scale manipulation of the planetary environment to counteract anthropogenic climate change. However, despite this interest, there has been a lack of accessible, high quality information on the proposed geoengineering techniques which remain unproven and potentially dangerous. This study provides a detailed assessment of the various methods and considers the potential efficiency and unintended consequences they may pose. It divides geoengineering methods into two basic categories: 1. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) techniques, which remove CO2 from the atmosphere. As they address the root cause of climate change, rising CO2 concentrations, they have relatively low uncertainties and risks. However, these techniques work slowly to reduce global temperatures. 2. Solar Radiation Management (SRM) techniques, which reflect a small percentage of the sun's light and heat back into space. These methods act quickly, and so may represent the only way to lower global temperatures quickly in the event of a climate crisis. However, they only reduce some, but not all, effects of climate change, while possibly creating other problems . They also do not affect CO2 levels and therefore fail to address the wider effects of rising CO2, including ocean acidification. The report recommends: * Parties to the UNFCCC should make increased efforts towards mitigating and adapting to climate change and in particular to agreeing to global emissions reductions of at least 50\% on 1990 levels by 2050 and more thereafter; * CDR and SRM geoengineering methods should only be considered as part of a wider package of options for addressing climate change. CDR methods should be regarded as preferable to SRM methods. * Relevant UK government departments, in association with the UK Research Councils, should together fund a 10 year geoengineering research programme at a level of the order of £10M per annum. * The Royal Society, in collaboration with international science partners, should develop a code of practice for geoengineering research and provide recommendations to the international scientific community for a voluntary research governance framework. The Royal Society issued a call for submissions and convened a small ethics workshop as part of the evidence gathering process. More information is available in the main report.},

  abstract = {Prediction of seasonal mean All India Rainfall (AIR) is useful during extreme monsoon years (droughts and floods) when the rainfall anomaly is homogeneous over the country. It is, however, useless for any regional hydro-meteorological applications during ‘normal’ monsoon years (70 per cent of available record), when the rainfall anomaly is quite inhomogeneous within the country. Further, there exists an intrinsic limit to predict the seasonal mean monsoon. The theoretically achievable skill (with perfect model and near perfect data) for seasonal prediction of rainfall being barely useful, there is a need to explore an alternative strategy for monsoon prediction even if it is with a shorter lead time. Based on some of our previous work, we propose here that predicting the phases of the monsoon sub-seasonal oscillation (active and break spells) 3–4 weeks in advance is such an alternative strategy. We argue that such predictions would be more useful for regional hydro-meteorological applications. Potential for such extended range prediction is demonstrated. Using an empirical model, it is further demonstrated that this potential can be achieved and useful prediction of monsoon breaks three weeks in advance could be made. Future direction in improving such extended range prediction of sub-seasonal spells is discussed.},

  abstract = {An idealized theoretical model is developed for the acceleration of a two-dimensional, stratified current over a uniformly sloping bottom, driven by an imposed alongshelf pressure gradient and taking into account the effects of buoyancy advection in the bottom boundary layer. Both downwelling and upwelling pressure gradients are considered. For a specified pressure gradient, the model response depends primarily on the Burger number S ϭ N␣/f, where N is the initial buoyancy frequency, ␣ is the bottom slope, and f is the Coriolis parameter. Without stratification (S ϭ 0), buoyancy advection is absent, and the alongshelf flow accelerates until bottom stress balances the imposed pressure gradient. The e-folding time scale to reach this steady state is the friction time, h/r, where h is the water depth and r is a linear bottom friction coefficient. With stratification (S 0), buoyancy advection in the bottom boundary layer produces vertical shear, which prevents the bottom stress from becoming large enough to balance the imposed pressure gradient for many friction time scales. Thus, the alongshelf flow continues to accelerate, potentially producing large velocities. The acceleration increases rapidly with increasing S, such that even relatively weak stratification (S Ͼ 0.2) has a major impact. These results are supported by numerical model calculations.},

Within the bottom boundary layer, vertical shear in the horizontal velocities is assumed to result only from horizontal density gradients.

The simulated meancirculation,as well as the eddy activity, is satisfactoryfor a 1/3ø model resolution, and the meridional heat transport at 30øS is within the range estimated from observations. We use the "mixed" open boundary algorithm of Barnlet et al. [1998],whichhasboth a radiationconditionand a relaxationto climatology. The climatological boundary forcing strongly constrains the solution in the whole domain. The modelheat balanceadjuststhroughthe surface(heat flux retroaction term) more than the open boundaries.The radiation phasevelocitiescalculated within the algorithm are analyzed. This shows, quite surprisingly, that both the eastern and western boundarieshave a similar behavior, regardlessof the preferred directionsfor advection(mainlyeastward)andwavepropagation(mainlywestward). Our results confirm that open boundary algorithms behave differently according to the dynamics of the region considered. The passiveboundary condition that Penduffet al.

  volume = {35},
  abstract = {This paper investigates the behavior of a surface-intensified anticyclone encountering a seamount on the ␤ plane in a stratified ocean. The eddy may be strongly eroded, and sometimes subdivided, provided that it gets close enough to the seamount. In case of subdivision, the detached part has a vertical structure different from that of the initial eddy, and a subsurface vortex may result. The basic erosion mechanism previously observed with f-plane experiments is still active on the ␤ plane. Deep fluid motions induced by the initial vortex across the isobaths generate topographic vortices whose upper parts exert a shear/strain on the initial eddy, causing its filamentation. On the ␤ plane, this process is further complicated by the presence of additional eddies created by fluid motion across the planetary vorticity gradient. Experiments without any topography show that these eddies by themselves can erode the initial vortex. In particular, a deep positive potential vorticity pole influences the near-bottom signature of the original vortex with a strong temporal variability. This reflects on the manner in which the surface eddy feels an underlying seamount. Sensitivity experiments show that the eddy erosion rate after encountering a seamount can no longer be related to basic parameters such as the minimum eddy–seamount distance, as it was on the f plane. The additional vorticity poles influencing the eddy on the ␤ plane make the result of the eddy–seamount encounter very sensitive to small variations of the initial conditions, and impossible to predict.},

  abstract = {The Gulf of Mexico Loop Current intruded upon the West Florida continental shelf in June 2000. In situ currents and hydrography along with satellite temperature and altimetry measurements are used to describe this event and its effects on the shelf. A strong southward current is observed to ﬂow along the shelf slope seaward of the intruded water boundary. This current transported cold, nutrient-rich water from the north, thereby producing anomalous hydrographic features near the shelf break (80-m isobath). An array of moored velocity proﬁlers reveals that the currents landward of the intruded water are independent of the Loop Current and primarily driven by local winds. A series of idealized numerical model simulations inclusive of forcing by both the Loop Current and local winds conﬁrm the observational ﬁndings that the shelfbreak currents are largely Loop Current controlled while the shelf currents are largely controlled by the local winds.},

These data are combined with estimates of the timing of the spawning and the duration of larval stages to create stock-specific annual indices of ring activity and shelf-slope front variability. There is evidence that increased warm core ring activity reduces recruitment in the 17 ground fish stocks examined, with the exception of cod from Georges Bank. A similar analysis of 7 pelagic stocks and one shellfish stock showed no consistent evidence that warm core rings reduce their recruitment; however, the recruitment data for many of these pelagic species are less reliable than for the groundfish stocks.},

  abstract = {Influence of the freshwater influx, the wind forcing and the Indian Ocean monsoon drift current on the property distributions and the circulation in the Bay of Bengal during southwest monsoon has been quantified. At the head of the Bay, waters of low salinity, affected by the freshwater influx, occupy the upper 90 m water column. The isohaline 34.0 x 10-3 separating these waters from those of underlying saline waters shoals southward gradually and outcrops around 14N, ION and 6N in the western, central and southeastern regions of the Bay respectively. The wind-stress-cur\textbackslash{}-induced upwelling effect is confined to depth limits of 50-100 m as is supported by a band of cold (24°-19°C) water in the central Bay. In the southern and central regions of the Bay, the monsoon drift current feeds the large scale cyclonic gyre apart from maintaining the northward flowing boundary current in the eastern Bay. A warm (27°-23°C), saline (35.0-35.2 x 10-3) watermass is advected northeastward along with the monsoon drift current into the Bay up to 14N at the depth limits of 50-100 m. Below this depth, in the western Bay a well-defined southward flow in the form of a boundary current is documented. Intense vertical mixing is inferred at the zones of salinity fronts in the depth limits of 40-100 m and also at deeper depths ({$>$} 2200 m) and elsewhere lateral mixing is predominant.},

Technological developments generally led (rather than followed) new ideas. The advent of satellite remote sensing led to global sampling with adequate spatial sampling density (two quite different achievements, both of enormous consequence). Computers permitted the timely reduction of very large datasets of disparate observations into digestible displays, including also meaningful estimates of the uncertainties of the measured fields. Underlying all these development is a century of transition from grossly inadequate expeditionary sampling to an appreciation of a rational sampling strategy. At the opening ceremony of the Lisbon 1998 EXPO, David Halpern assigned me to speak on "Oceanography Before Satellites" and allocated five minutes to do so. Yes, there was oceanography before satellites (Figure 1). I now have a generous eight pages to review the last hundred years.

  abstract = {Measurements of water properties in the Great South Channel (GSC) made on 35 surveys between 1977 and 1985 indicate an intrusion of high salinity water in the autumn of most years. The intrusion represents an influx of slope water. It is most evident near bottom, but high salinity values are found throughout the water column. In some years the intrusion can be traced through the channel to the north side of Georges Bank. Larvae of offshore, warm-water fish species found in the high salinity intrusion support reports that the presence of these larvae is associated with an influx of slope water through the channel. The influx is likely to be associated with the seasonal shelfward movement of the shelf/slope front during the autumn. While the extent of the influx may be modified by Gulf Stream rings located south of the channel region, the phenomenon does not appear to be caused by rings. The influx of slope water across the shelf and to GSC suggests a seasonal reduction in the transport of Georges Bank water westward past Nantucket Shoals.},

  title = {Diverging {{Color Maps}} for {{Scientiﬁc Visualization}} ({{Expanded}})},
  abstract = {One of the most fundamental features of scientiﬁc visualization is the process of mapping scalar values to colors. This process allows us to view scalar ﬁelds by coloring surfaces and volumes. Unfortunately, the majority of scientiﬁc visualization tools still use a color map that is famous for its ineﬀectiveness: the rainbow color map. This color map, which na¨ıvely sweeps through the most saturated colors, is well known for its ability to obscure data, introduce artifacts, and confuse users. Although many alternate color maps have been proposed, none have achieved widespread adoption by the visualization community for scientiﬁc visualization. This paper explores the use of diverging color maps (sometimes also called ratio, bipolar, or double-ended color maps) for use in scientiﬁc visualization, provides a diverging color map that generally performs well in scientiﬁc visualization applications, and presents an algorithm that allows users to easily generate their own customized color maps.},

  abstract = {Nowadays the simulation of free surface flow and transport in rivers, estuaries and seas is often based upon three-dimensional modelling systems. Most of these three-dimensional modelling systems use sigma co-ordinates in the vertical. By the use of the sigma transformation the water column can be divided into the same number of layers independently of the water depth. Especially for steep bottom slopes combined with vertical stratification of the density, sigma-transformed grids impose numerical problems for the accurate approximation of horizontal gradients. This paper deals with algorithms for the approximation in sigma co-ordinates of the horizontal diffusive fluxes of temperature and salinity and for the approximation of the horizontal pressure gradients. The approximation of the horizontal diffusive fluxes is based upon a finite volume method. The approximation of the pressure gradients is directly related to the approximation of the diffusivefluxes. Artificial vertical diffusion and artificial flow due to truncation errors are minimized. The method described in this paper is not hampered by the so-called ‘hydrostatic consistency condition’. This will be illustrated by numerical experiments.},

Emphasis is put on summarizing characteristics typical for dynamically distinct regions of the World Ocean. This effort results in an attempt to describe the observed ocean variability in terms of universal spectral relations that depend only on few mean ﬂow parameters such as the ﬁrst-mode Rossby radius of deformation.

The remainder of the chapter is dedicated to the application of these fundamentals to estuaries, river plumes, and the shelf seas. We categorize estuaries as persistently stratified, periodically stratified, and unstratified, and discuss the structure and variability of turbulent mixing in each case. The direct interaction of freshwater flows and the coastal ocean is considered in the context of mixing in river plumes, where we define the structure of the plume and consider both active and passive mixing of the plume. Finally, mixing in shelf seas, where the stratification may be due to either freshwater influence or thermal structure, we consider both spatial and temporal variability of mixing and stratification.},

Typical flows far from the hill were from the west and south, and of the order of 2.5 cm s i at the level of the hill top. Near the hill the currents at this level were accelerated on the western flank and reduced to the east by an anticyclonic flow perturbation giving a velocity difference across the hill of 3 to 5 cm s- 1. CTD (conductivity temperature depth) profiles showed a doming of isotherms over the hill and potential temperatures on top of the hill that were as low as on the abyssal plain 500 m below. The profiles also revealed that topographically induced density perturbations penetrated to approximately 2.5 times the height of the hill above the abyssal plain. The observations compare reasonably with a theoretical stratified Taylor column model.},

Along the western boundary, the wind-driven transport is returned across latitude lines by the bottom pressure torque, while friction is only important in altering the PV within an isopycnic layer and in allowing a closed circulation. These contrasting balances constrain the geometry of the flow through integral relationships for the BV and PV. For both homogenous and stratified basins with sloping sidewalls, the northward subtropical jet separates from the western wall and has opposing frictional torques on either side of the jet, which cancel in a zonal integral for BV but alter the PV within a layer streamline. In a channel with partial topographic barriers, the bottom pressure torque is again important in returning wind-driven flows along western boundaries and in transferring BV from neighboring wind-driven gyres into a zonal jet. The depth-integrated flow steered by topography controls where the bottom friction alters the PV, which can lead to different PV states being attained for separate subbasins along a channel.},

  issn = {01980149},
  abstract = {Warm-core eddies in at least three different current systems have been observed to evolve over a few weeks' time from local minima to local maxima in phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity. The causes of this biological enrichment have been uncertain. We report here a possible explanation of this phenomenon, based on events observed in Gulf Stream warmcore ring 82-B. During the time when a phytoplankton biomass maximum was present in this ring, nutrient concentration gradients beneath a nutrient-depleted surface layer were consistently both greater in magnitude and closer to the sea surface in the interior of the ring than in the surrounding Slope Water. In addition, surface-layerdensitieswere greater inside than outside the ring, resulting in much smaller density differences between the surface and the nitracline (shallowest depth at which nitrate was detectable by conventional methods). The cumulative result of these two factors was that, compared to the surrounding Slope Water, less than one fifth as much wind energy would have been needed near the center of the ring to mix the water column from the nitracline to the surface. The altered nutrient and density profiles within the ring were consistent with physical and biologicalmodels of eddy dynamics, which predict that the frictional decay of the rotational flow field should result in shoaling of the main thermocline, and thus upwelling, in the interior of a warm-core eddy. There is reasonably good quantitative agreement between calculated rates of vertical nutrient transport associated with upwelling in the interior of the ring and the measured net uptake rates of nitrate and silicic acid by the phytoplankton.},

A second biomass maximum associated with shelf surface water was being entrained into the anticyclonic flow field of the ring 60 to 711 km from its center. Maximum chlorophyll a and ATP concentrations observed in the two biomass maxima were similar, but the ring-center maximum was 2 to 10 times richer in particulate carbon, biogenic silica, particles {$>$}5 lam in diameter, dinoflagellatcs, diatoms and estimated organic detritus, while the entrained shelf water had 2 to 5 times greater abundances of unicellular monads. Heterotrophic bacterial abundance and biomass, and the abundance of coccoid cyanobacteria were maximal in the region of highest rotational velocity 40 to 50 km from ring center. In this region the abundances of bacteria and cyanobacteria were 2 to 5 times as great as at the center of the ring.},

  title = {Convection in {{Small Basins}}},
  volume = {32},
  abstract = {Convection in the world’s oceans often occurs in small, semienclosed basins where bottom slopes and nearby continental shelf breaks are commonplace. The evolution of convectively generated heat anomalies in such settings is studied using quasigeostrophic ﬁnite-difference and point vortex models. The displayed behaviors divide essentially into two categories: whole ﬂuid column convection, in which bottom-slope effects are felt immediately, and partial ﬂuid column convection, in which the topographic effects can be delayed. In both cases, topography signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the evolution of convective patches from that occurring over ﬂat bottoms. Vertical walls induce strong self-propagation mechanisms that accelerate alongslope heat transport, while the continental shelf slope is repulsive and rejects lower-layer anticyclones. These anomalies are then ‘‘stranded,’’ being too far offshore to interact with the shelf break and having lost their heton partner in the interaction. Weaker deep ocean topographic slopes disrupt heton formation and disperse convective patches by topographic mechanisms. Partial ﬂuid column convection, with stratiﬁcation under the mixed layer, proceeds through a cascade from small to large length scales. In oceanically relevant regimes, smaller scales are shielded from bottom slopes and can disperse as small hetons. Largerscale structures are prevented by the topography from forming into hetons and instead evolve as if in a sloping-bottom two-layer system. The small hetons, when encountering shelf breaks, can experience topographic repulsion and stranding. Comparisons with the Mediterranean Sea suggest alternative interpretations for some observations, and several observed Labrador Sea mesoscale convective characteristics can be ascribed to topographic effects.},

Spatial correlations of drifter data show the along-shelf and cross-shelf decorrelation distances are approximately 45 and 25 km, respectively. This information is used to make the objective streamfunction and velocity potential maps. The total velocity is represented as the sum of the rotational, nondivergent streamfunction component and the irrotational, divergent velocity potential component. The velocity derived from the streamfunction is much stronger than that derived from the velocity potential. The streamfunction is sufﬁciently well resolved to make meaningful vorticity maps. The velocity potential indicates a source term in the western Santa Barbara Channel consistent with wind stress curl-driven upwelling, but divergence maps derived from the velocity potential are very noisy, making comparisons with wind stress curl mapped on the same scales problematic.},

It begins with a discussion of the fundamental three-dimensional (3D) equations that are used to describe water movements in coastal waters and in estuaries. The conditions required for closing the Navier–Stokes system of equations are presented next in their Cartesian coordinate version. The governing equations are then transformed into spherical coordinates before addressing some of the most common simplifications: their 2D, depth-averaged, and width-averaged versions and the 1D, cross-sectional averaged version. It then describes in broad terms techniques for assimilation of data into numerical models, paying special attention to the Kalman filter family. In the latter part of the chapter, a range of numerical models are described, from 3D to 2D and 1D models, with examples of their application to different areas, from coastal to estuarine systems, and to different problems.},

  abstract = {The initial-value problem for the evolution of an isolated vortex encountering a tall seamount during its westward beta-drift is studied within an equivalent-barotropic model, that is generalized to allow for the intersection of the layer interface with a sloping bottom. Given the Rossby radius and linear wave speed in the model, the parabolic shape of a seamount top and initial potential vorticity proﬁle in the vortex core, the outcome is controlled by the vortex sign and a number of parameters: the seamount radius and height of penetration into the active layer, the radius and intensity of the vortex, the initial offset of the vortex center relative to the seamount, the Ekman layer depth over the seamount top, and the momentum lateral diffusion coefﬁcient. Here we consider regimes for narrow seamounts where cyclonic vorticity generated in the water column swept off the top of the seamount plays a negligible role. The most signiﬁcant effect on the vortex evolution is provided by a topographically induced anticyclonic circulation that is formed after squashing of water column replaced over the top of the seamount by the approaching vortex. The Geostrophic Vorticity intermediate model is used for numerical experiments. When the area of penetration is small and the topographic anticyclone is weak, the vortex drifts either predominantly westward north of the seamount or rotates around the seamount which is explained by presence of a separatrix in a simple kinematic model. For a larger area of penetration and stronger topographic anticyclone, violent interactions result in substantial deformations of the vortex core and loss of the material from the vortex periphery that leads to anomalous transport and diffusion. Vortex capture over the seamount is found in one range of parameters.},

The existence of a typical mesoscale ChI patch size is documented by horizontal chlorophyll variance spectra displaying a secondary spectral peak at wavelengths between 10 and 20 krn, in addition to the lowwavenumber peak at wavelengths between 100 and 300 km associated with the energy-containing eddies. The typical sub eddy-scale patch size coincides with the local internal Rossby-radius of deformation. The input to the ChI variance spectrum at a 10-20 km wavelength is explained by primary production stimulated during mesoscale upwelling at fronts. The mesoscale patches with highest chlorophyll concentrations occur at those sites where the hydrographic conditions are favourable for dynamic upwelling or where the distributions of the hydrographic variables indicate local upwelling events.},

  abstract = {Intermediate, or deep, convection in a baroclinic ﬂow occurs along slanted paths parallel to the alongﬂow absolute momentum surfaces. These surfaces are principally tilted due to the vertical shear in velocity but can be further modiﬁed by a nonvertical axis of rotation. An inviscid Lagrangian parcel model, using realistic parameters, is utilized to illustrate, qualitatively, the different scenarios resulting from the combined action of inertial and gravitational forces acting on sinking parcels of dense ﬂuid. More quantitative results are derived from a series of numerical experiments using a zonally invariant, high-resolution, nonhydrostatic model. Convection occuring in a ﬂow with tilted absolute momentum surfaces will mix properties along these slanted surfaces. This implies that the ﬂuid can retain a weak vertical stratiﬁcation while overturning and also, more importantly, that the evolution of the convective layer cannot be described in terms of one-dimensional, vertical mixing. The authors show, for conditions typical of the Labrador Sea, that the convective layer depth difference between that estimated by mixing vertically and one obtained allowing for slantwise mixing can be greater than 100 m; slantwise convection reaches deeper because of the reduced stratiﬁcation along the slanted paths. An alternative slantwise mixing scheme, based on the assumption of zero potential vorticity of the convected ﬂuid, is proposed.},

  abstract = {Recent observations have suggested that the trapped-front model of Chapman and Lentz is consistent with some aspects of the shelfbreak front in the Middle Atlantic Bight. The sensitivity of the model to the parameterization of vertical mixing is examined to determine which model features are robust and potentially observable and which are variable and less reliable. The basic frontal trapping mechanism, frontal location, surface intensiﬁed frontal jet with weak ﬂow at the bottom, and detachment of the bottom boundary layer at the shoreward edge of the foot of the front are all insensitive to the parameterization of vertical mixing. On the other hand, the frontal shape and width and the cross-frontal circulation and momentum balances within the front change dramatically with the parameterization of vertical mixing. Constant mixing coefﬁcients produce strong vertical mixing within the front, which results in steady shoreward ﬂow in the bottom boundary layer there. Mixing coefﬁcients that depend on the local stratiﬁcation and shear produce weak vertical mixing within the front, which allows oscillating currents that may be frontal-trapped waves.},

This has had the consequence that its physical significance for processes in the atmosphere, as well for simple mechanical systems, has not been fully comprehended. A study of Coriolis’s own scientific career and achievements shows how the discovery of the Coriolis force was linked, not to any earth sciences, but to early nineteenth century mechanics and industrial developments. His own approach, which followed from a general discussion of the energetics of a rotating mechanical system, provides an alternative and more physical way to look at and understand, for example, its property as a complementary centrifugal force. It also helps to clarify the relation between angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy and how an inertial force can have a significant affect on the movement of a body and still without doing any work. Applying Coriolis’s principles elucidates cause and effect aspects of the dynamics and energetics of the atmosphere, the geostrophic adjustment process, the circulation around jet streams, the meridional extent of the Hadley cell, the strength and location of the subtropical jet stream, and the phenomenon of “downstream development” in the zonal westerlies.},

  abstract = {A primitive equation model is used to study the finite-amplitude evolution of instabilities associated with the coastal upwelling front. Simulations of increasing complexity are examined that represent idealizations of summer conditions off the Oregon coast, including cases with steady and with time-variable wind in a domain with alongshore-uniform bathymetry and with time-variable wind in a domain with realistic Oregon coast bathymetry. The numerical results indicate that the fastest-growing mode in this system has approximately an 8–10-km alongshore wavelength but that, once the disturbances grow to finite amplitude, the predominant alongfront scale increases rapidly because of nonlinear effects. Separation of the total kinetic energy into contributions from the alongshore average flow and perturbation about that average shows that the initial growth of the perturbation kinetic energy is due to potential energy conversion, but transfer of energy from the kinetic energy of the alongshore average flow becomes important once the disturbances reach large amplitude. The time-variable wind simulations again show initial growth of small-scale instabilities followed by evolution to larger scales. In this case, however, even after larger-scale disturbances have developed on the upwelling front, smaller-scale patterns amplify along the front in response to each upwelling-favorable wind event. Realistic coastal bathymetry introduces additional alongshore topographic scales into the problem, but the formation of instabilities on small scales and evolution to larger scales are still ubiquitous. Where instabilities encounter strong curvature in the upwelling front produced by bathymetric effects, the upwelling front becomes highly contorted and horizontal variability is significantly enhanced.},

The models are forced by wind stress fields similar in structure to the intense winter-time, mountain-pass jets (-20 dyne/cm2) that appear in the Gulfs of Tehuantepec and Papagayo for periods of 3-10 days. Solutions are arranged in a hierarchy of increasing dynamical complexity, in order to illustrate the important physical processes. They compare favorably with observations in several ways. Some properties of solutions are the following. While the wind strengthens there is an ageostrophic current (not Ekman drift) that is directed offshore. This offshore drift forces coastal upwelling, thereby lowering the local sea level and sea surface temperature (SST).},

  issn = {0022-3670, 1520-0485},
  abstract = {Observational and model estimates of the form drag on Three Tree Point, a headland located in a tidal channel of Puget Sound, Washington, are presented. Subsurface, Three Tree Point is a sloping ridge. Tidal flow over this ridge gives rise to internal lee waves that lead to wave drag and enhanced mixing. At the same time, horizontal flow separation produces a headland eddy that distorts the surface height field in the lee of the point. Two observational methods for estimating the portion of the form drag associated with deformation of the surface height field, referred to here as the “external” form drag, are also introduced. Drogued drifters and ship-mounted acoustic current profiles from different days are used to indirectly map the flood-tide surface height field. Data are derived from a depth shallow enough that baroclinic pressure gradient forcing may be neglected, and yet deep enough that wind stress may also be ignored. This leaves an approximate balance between the acceleration and surface height pressure gradient, permitting, in this case, two independent estimates of the surface height (to within a constant). These fields are used to calculate the external form drag at the headland. Drag estimates from both observational datasets agree well. External form drag decreases offshore of the headland as expected, and is highly dependent on tidal phase, with maximum drag leading peak flood currents by 1–2 h at this location. Form drag is much larger than model estimates of the frictional drag, implying that it is the dominant mechanism extracting energy from the barotropic tide. A kinematic argument is also presented to show why the external form drag should increase in importance relative to the frictional drag as the topographic slope and tidal excursion increase.},

  abstract = {Momentum balances in the near-ﬁeld region of a large, tidally pulsed river plume are examined. The authors concentrate on a single ebb tide of the Columbia River plume, using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) conﬁgured to hindcast ﬂow conditions on the Washington and Oregon shelves and in the Columbia River estuary. During ebb, plume-interior streamwise balances are largely between advection, pressure gradient, and frictional forces. Stream-normal balances in this region reduce to centrifugal, crossstream pressure gradient, and Coriolis terms (i.e., the ‘‘gradient wind’’ balance commonly assumed in river plume bulge investigations). Temporal derivatives are most important at the plume front and as the ebb progresses. Winds were light and contributed little to the force balance. Midebb stress and vertical salt ﬂux were largest at a midplume depth, where stratiﬁcation and vertical shear were also high, consistent with shearinduced mixing. Internal stress slows the spreading plume considerably. A kinematic description of the spreading process relates lateral spreading to the momentum dynamics and illustrates that plume spreading is largely a competition between the cross-stream pressure gradient and Coriolis forces. However, the very nearﬁeld dome of buoyant water is instrumental in setting initial ﬂow pathways.},

  volume = {5},
  issn = {1812-0792},
  abstract = {The Kuroshio ﬂows along the edges of the marginal East Asian seas such as the South China Sea (SCS) and East China Sea (ECS). Exchanges of materials and energy between the Kuroshio and the marginal seas partly control the environments of the marginal seas. In particular, saline water from the Kuroshio maintains certain salinity in the shelf water in the ECS. Nutrients from the subsurface of the Kuroshio may inﬂuence primary production on the shelf. We summarize how the Kuroshio comes into contact with the shelf water or marginal seas, describing phenomena related to the exchange between the Kuroshio and the ECS along with the SCS, using reports in the literature along with original data. The Kuroshio tends to intrude into the SCS through the Luzon Strait in various manners such as direct intrusion, associated with eddies and as a loop current. The Kuroshio intrusion into the shelf region of the ECS has distinct seasonal variation and the Taiwan Warm Current plays a signiﬁcant role in the determination of water properties in the outer shelf associated with the Kuroshio intrusion. We then examine physical processes related to the interaction between the Kuroshio and shelf water. Interaction between the Kuroshio and the bottom topography is an important process in the control of the exchange around the shelf break. Vertical mixing and frontal eddies are also important factors that control the water exchange and formation of water masses in the outer shelf. Wind stress plays a signiﬁcant role in the exchange with a rather event-like manner. To determine the source of the water masses, chemical tracers could be powerful tools and it is suggested that a signiﬁcant part of the shelf water consists of Kuroshio intermediate water.},

  abstract = {The summertime front near the shelf break in the Middle Atlantic Bight is both thermohaline and baroclinic. Near the surface, large gradients of temperature (T) and salinity (8) exist with little cross-frontal variation in density. At depths {$>$}50 m, an isopycnal boundary separates Slope Water from colder, fresher shelf water. Higher concentrations of chlorophyll are found in the upper part of the front, between water types of shelf and Slope Water origin. Calculations show also that the front is a region of enhanced phytoplankton growth. It is proposed that the relative fertility of the front is the result of large-scale deformations of the T/8 boundary between shelf and Slope Water. The entrainment of deep shelf water along the shallowing, seaward-sloping, isopycnals in the deeper part of the front by these large-scale perturbations bring turbid, nutrient-rich water into clearer water that is also nutrient poor. The combination of this nutrient enrichment and a well-lighted water column makes the front more productive than elsewhere.},

  volume = {3},
  issn = {14635003},
  abstract = {Regional oceanic models can be developed and used eciently for the investigation of regional and coastal domains, provided a satisfactory prescription for the open boundary conditions (OBCs) is found. We propose in this paper an adaptive algorithm where inward and outward information ¯uxes are treated separately. Because of the essentially hyperbolic nature of the incompressible, hydrostatic Primitive Equations, external data are required only for inward boundary ¯uxes. The outward ¯uxes are treated with a new algorithm for two-dimensional radiation. Special attention is given to the estimation of the radiation phase speed, essential for detecting the direction of boundary ¯uxes. The boundary conditions are applied and assessed on a US West Coast (USWC) con®guration of the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS). Our guiding principles are that the numerical solution be stable over multiple years, reach a meaningful statistical equilibrium, and be realistic with respect to the available observational data. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the oblique radiation is robust and suciently accurate to detect the direction of information ¯uxes. The adaptive nudging adequately incorporates the external information minimizing over- and under-speci®cation problems. In addition, a volume constraint based on global correction of normal barotropic velocities improves the overall performances of the open boundary conditions. Ó 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {This paper presents the analysis of symmetric circulations of a rotating baroclinic ﬂow, forced by a steady thermal wind and dissipated by Laplacian friction. The analysis is performed with numerical time-integration. Symmetric ﬂows, vertically bound by horizontal walls and subject to either periodic or vertical wall lateral boundary conditions, are investigated in the region of parameter-space where unstable small amplitude modes evolve into stable stationary nonlinear solutions. The distribution of solutions in parameter-space is analysed up to the threshold of chaotic behaviour and the physical nature of the nonlinear interaction operating on the ﬁnite amplitude unstable modes is investigated. In particular, analysis of time-dependent energyconversions allows understanding of the physical mechanisms operating from the initial phase of linear instability to the ﬁnite amplitude stable state. Vertical shear of the basic ﬂow is shown to play a direct role in injecting energy into symmetric ﬂow since the stage of linear growth. Dissipation proves essential not only in limiting the energy of linearly unstable modes, but also in selecting their dominant spacescales in the ﬁnite amplitude stage.},

  volume = {34},
  abstract = {The multiscale nonlinear interactive Iceland–Faeroe frontal (IFF) variability during 14–22 August 1993 is investigated for complex dynamics with the localized multiscale energy and vorticity analysis (MS-EVA). In terms of multiscale window transform, the cold meandering intrusion observed in the IFF experiment is represented on a mesoscale window. The resulting mesoscale energetics for the deep layer show an isolated center of transfer of potential energy from the large-scale window into the mesoscale window in the study domain. This large-to-mesoscale potential energy transfer, or BC for short, is a baroclinic instability indicator by the MS-EVA-based stability theory. Signatures on other energetics maps and the reconstructed mesoscale structures all support this baroclinic instability. On the BC map, the transfer hotspot originally resides near the western boundary. It travels along the front into the interior domain in a form of convective instability and then, on 19 August, changes into another instability that is absolute in character. Correspondingly, disturbances switch from a spatial growing pattern into a time growing mode, culminating on 21 August, the day just before the intrusion matures. The whole process lasts for about ﬁve days, limited within a small horizontal region and beneath a depth of approximately 150 m. By interaction analysis, the energy locally gained from this process goes to the submesoscale window as well, but most of it remains in the mesoscale window, serving to fuel the growth of the meandering intrusion.},

  abstract = {General governing equations for estuaries and coastal regions are given as a special case of those of Newtonian fluids under the influence of turbulence, density gradient, atmospheric pressure gradient, and tide-generating force. The equations are then simplified for barotropic motion, particularly tidal, seiche, and tidally-driven motions. The linearized equations are used to discuss frictional tidal propagation in an elongated straight channel. The importance of the Earth’s rotation is then discussed with the Kelvin wave solutions in a long channel. For barotropic tidal or seiche problems, the Earth’s rotation is shown to be quite small in general when there is no stratification. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) models are then discussed for the effect of variable bathymetry. The bottom friction and cross-channel depth variations are shown to have significant effect on the tidal phase and tidal ellipses of the current velocity. The sub-tidal (or residual) flow is then discussed for variable depth problems. Some relevant observations of sub-tidal flows are then analyzed. A technique to separate barotropic from baroclinic motions is discussed and the effect of channel curvature examined using both analytic model and observations. It is demonstrated that the advective nonlinearity is a dominant term when channel curvature and bathymetry variations are significant.},

As long as the isosurfaces of vertical coordinate are not aligned with either geopotential surfaces or isopycnals, the horizontal pressure gradient consists of two large terms that tend to cancel each other. The associated pressure gradient error stems from interference of the discretization errors of these terms. The situation is further complicated by the non-orthogonality of the terrain-following coordinate system and by the common practice of using highly non-uniform stretching for the vertical grids, which, unless special precautions are made, causes both loss of accuracy of vertical discretization, and increase in interference in the error of the pressure gradient force.},

  abstract = {Satellite observations reveal a mesoscale oceanic circulation dominated by turbulence that is correlated, in most cases, with local baroclinicity. Linear baroclinic instability theory has proved useful in understanding the time and space scales of atmospheric eddies. The question addressed here is, to what degree can the observed oceanic eddy activity be understood through a local, linear stability analysis? This question is addressed as follows. A local quasigeostrophic linear stability calculation is performed on a grid of wavenumbers, ranging in magnitude about the local deformation wavenumber, for each vertical proﬁle in a dataset of neutral density for the world’s oceans. The initial results show that nearly the entire ocean is unstable, but in many places, particularly in low latitudes, the instability is dominated by surface intensiﬁed modes, resulting in very small-scale, quickly growing waves. At higher latitudes, the primary instabilities are due to thermocline depth shears and have a broader vertical structure. For each unstable wave, at each location, the mean-to-eddy energy conversion rate is also calculated and used to select the growing waves that are both fast and have signiﬁcant energetic conversion potential. This procedure removes most of the surface-instabilities, which cannot lead to signiﬁcant energy conversion, and reveals the slower but more powerful thermocline-level instabilities where they exist.},

The physical variable which best describes the rotation and the density anomaly associated with coherent vortices is potential vorticity. It is diagnostically related to velocity and pressure, when the vortex is stationary. Stationary vortices can be monopolar (circular or elliptical) or multipolar; their stability analysis shows that transitions between the various stationary shapes are possible when they become unstable. But stable vortices can also undergo unsteady evolutions when perturbed by environmental effects, like large-scale shear or strain ﬁelds, β-effect or topography. Changes in vortex shapes can also result from vortex interactions. such as the pairing, merger or vertical alignment of two vortices, which depend on their relative polarities and depths. Such interactions transfer energy and enstrophy between scales, and are essential in two-dimensional and in geostrophic turbulence. Finally, in relation with the observations, we describe a few mechanisms of vortex generation.},

The regional K(490) algorithm has been applied on to the IRS-P4 Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM) satellite data and a limited validation of the algorithm has been performed for case I and case II waters off Gujarat coast in the Arabian Sea. The results of the satellite validation experiment conducted in the Arabian Sea for K(490) algorithm show that the algorithm captures very well the in situ K(490) values (RMS=0.011 m-1). The algorithm has also been validated for an independent in situ data set collected during SK-186 data collection campaign in the Arabian Sea; a good correlation was obtained for this data (r2 = 0.80, N=41).},

  abstract = {Traditional ocean modeling treats ﬁelds resolved on the model grid according to the classical dynamics of continua. Variability on smaller scales is included through sundry ‘‘eddy viscosities’’, ‘‘mixing coeﬃcients’’ and other schemes. In this paper we develop an alternative approach based on statistical dynamics. First, we recognize that we treat probabilities of ﬂows, not the ﬂows themselves. Modeled dependent variables are the moments (expectations) of the probabilities of possible ﬂows. Second, we address the challenge to obtain the equations of motion for the moments of probable ﬂows rather than the (traditional) equations for explicit ﬂows. For linear terms and on larger resolved scales, the statistical equations agree with classical dynamics where those of traditional modeling works well. Diﬀerences arise where traditional modeling would relegate unresolved motion to ‘‘eddy viscosity’’, etc.. Instead, changes of entropy ({$<$}Àlog P{$>$} over the probability distribution of possible ﬂows) with respect to the modeled moments act as forcings upon those moments. In this way we obtain a consistent framework for specifying the terms which, traditionally, represent subgridscale eﬀects. Although these statistical equations are close to the classical equations in many ways, important diﬀerences are also evident; here, two phenomena are described where the results diﬀer. We consider eddies interacting with bottom topography. It is seen that traditional ‘‘eddy viscosity’’ and/or ‘‘topographic drag’’, which would reduce large scale ﬂows toward rest, are wrong. The second law of thermodynamics is violated; the ‘‘arrow of time’’ is running backwards! From statistical dynamics, approximate corrections are obtained, yielding a practical improvement to the ﬁdelity of ocean models. Another phenomenon occurs at much smaller scales in the turbulent mixing of heat and salt. Even when both heat and salt are stably stratifying, their rates of turbulent transfer should diﬀer. This suggests a further model improvement.},

  title = {A {{Model}} for {{Vortex}}-{{Trapped Internal Waves}}},
  volume = {28},
  issn = {0022-3670, 1520-0485},
  abstract = {Regions of negative vorticity are observed to trap and amplify near-inertial internal waves, which are sources of turbulent mixing 10–100 times higher than typically found in the stratiﬁed ocean interior. Because these regions are of ﬁnite lateral extent, trapped waves will not form a continuum but be quantized in modes. A model for the radial structure of near-inertial azimuthal modes in an axisymmetric vortex is described in order to explain intense near-inertial motions observed in the cores of a Gulf Stream warm-core ring and a vortex cap above Fieberling Seamount. Observed signals exhibit little variability of the rectilinear phase ␾ ϭ arctan(␷/u) in the core and evanesce rapidly outside the swirl velocity maximum, where u is the zonal velocity and ␷ the meridional velocity. The authors focus on azimuthal mode n ϭ Ϫ1 (propagating clockwise around the vortex) and the gravest radial mode (no zero crossing) that appears to dominate observations. Model solutions resemble Bessel functions inside the velocity maximum and modiﬁed Bessel function decay outside, consistent with observations and solutions previously found by Kunze et al. using a less complete model. The improved model supports their conclusions concerning radial wavelengths, vertical group velocities, and energy ﬂuxes for trapped waves.},

  abstract = {Solutions are found for the flow field generated near a coast by the sudden application of an alongshore wind stress. Alongshore geostrophy is not assumed, and so the near-inertial oscillations are retained. The model is alongshore independent, hydrostatic, continuously stratified, has a well-mixed surface layer, and admits vertical diffusion in the interior. The asymptotic form of the solution for large time and freed position shows that the inertial oscillations decay like t-1/2, leaving behind an accelerating coastally trapped baroclinic jet and a steady upwelling circulation. Calculations for up to 5 days show coastal inhibition of the inertial oscillations within the Rossby radius, outside which they increase in large parts of the ocean interior. The increase is due in part to the downward leakage of coastal inertial energy from the mixed layer and in part to the offshore leakage near the bottom. Several weeks may be needed to obtain significant decay everywhere in the flow field. Estimates of certain properties of the inertial oscillations in the model are in fair agreement with observations.},

In both cases, signiﬁcant mixing also takes place prior to the transition to turbulence. Although Holmboe waves grow more slowly than Kelvin–Helmholtz waves, the net amount of mixing is comparable.

This wave radiation depletes the vortex energy, and causes cyclones to drift northward and anticylones southward (in the Northern Hemishpere).

From these solutions the radiated energy is calculated and then used to obtain a simple expression for the meridional drift.

  title = {A {{Different Outﬂow Length Scale}}?},
  volume = {34},
  abstract = {Using a nonlinear ‘‘reduced gravity’’ model it is shown analytically that a large buoyant midlatitude outﬂow situated along the northern boundary of a ␤-plane ocean produces an unusually broad westward ﬂow. The steady nonlinear outﬂow consists of a narrow jet (whose width is the familiar midlatitude Rossby radius) and a broad, nearly stagnant region whose width is the equatorial Rossby radius. The steady, inviscid solution reported here is constructed with the aid of the momentum-ﬂux equation. For high-Rossby-number ﬂows (i.e., zero potential vorticity ﬂows), the total outﬂow’s width is ϳ1.228 times the equatorial Rossby radius. A ﬁnite potential vorticity outﬂow produces a slightly narrower westward ﬂow. The above solution breaks down in the linear limit, and it is expected that a linear outﬂow would consist of a single ﬂow whose width is on the order of the midlatitude Rossby radius. Numerical simulations are in very good agreement with the above nonlinear solution. The new southward outﬂow solution reported here complements recently derived solutions for northward outﬂows, eastward outﬂows, and westward outﬂows. In the earlier northward outﬂow case (i.e., a light water source situated along a southern boundary), a chain of westward-propagating eddies and an eastward current are produced. This corresponds to the situation in the Gulf of Mexico where Loop Current eddies are generated. In the earlier eastward outﬂow case (i.e., a light water source situated along a western boundary), a steady gyre is generated. This corresponds to the Tsugaru gyre (in the western Paciﬁc) and the Alboran gyre (in the western Mediterranean). In the earlier westward outﬂow case (i.e., a source situated along an eastern boundary), a chain of westwardpropagating eddies and a northward current are produced. (The Southern Hemisphere analog of this case corresponds to the generation of teddies and the Leeuwin Current.) A new solution with the new length scale corresponds to outﬂows such as the one associated with the surface ﬂow (from the Atlantic to the Caribbean) through the Windward or Mona Passage. At present, there are no observations that can support or reject the scales suggested by the authors.},

  volume = {27},
  abstract = {The linear stability of two-layer primitive equation ocean rings is considered in the case when the rings are wide compared with a deformation radius, as is usually observed. Asymptotic theory is developed to show the existence of solutions for arbitrarily wide rings, and these solutions can be followed as the rings are made successively narrower. An exponential cubic radial dependence is used for the mean ﬂow, rather than the more usual Gaussian structure. There are two reasons: a Gaussian shape was fully discussed in a previous paper, and a Gaussian has exceptional properties, unlike other power laws. The speciﬁc cases of warm and cold Gulf Stream rings are considered in detail. The theory provides an accurate prediction of phase velocity and growth rate for cold rings and a reasonable prediction for warm rings. Solutions in the asymptotic regime have a larger growth rate than other (nonasymptotic) solutions for cold rings, but not for warm rings. Attention is given to the role of the mean barotropic circulation, which had been found in earlier work to have a strong effect on ring stability. There is still evidence for stabilization when the mean ﬂow in the lower layer vanishes, but other features are also involved. In particular, the linear stability of a ring appears to be as sensitive to subtle shape details as it is to the sense of the deep ﬂow. The authors generally ﬁnd warm co-rotating rings with a cubic exponential form to be unstable, although somewhat less so than counterrotating rings.},

  title = {Stability of {{Multilayer Ocean Vortices}}: {{A Parameter Study Including Realistic Gulf Stream}} and {{Agulhas Rings}}},
  volume = {33},
  abstract = {Ocean rings, when isolated from major ocean currents, can have life spans on the order of years. This study focuses on the stability of such isolated ocean rings. Assuming axisymmetric basic-state proﬁles, the linear stability of a wide variety of rings is analyzed by examining the properties of the modes to which they become unstable and the associated energy conversions. Earlier studies have indicated that corotating rings, with a large barotropic component, are far less unstable than counterrotating ones. This sharp contrast between co- and counterrotating rings appears to be a consequence of the choice for a radial proﬁle of the azimuthal velocity that decays only gradually on the ring’s outer ﬂank. For more realistic velocity proﬁles, co- and counterrotating rings have similar growth rates. Nearly compensated rings, that is, those with a weak ﬂow in the deepest layer, are found to be the least unstable ones. In this paper, the problem for warm-core rings with a Gaussian proﬁle is ﬁrst revisited in a two-layer setup. A systematic survey of the sensitivity of the results for this standard case with respect to various ring parameters, such as the stratiﬁcation, ring width, and, in particular, the radial proﬁle of the azimuthal velocity, is presented. Besides exponential proﬁles, as used in earlier studies, the stability of rings with a core in solid-body rotation is also examined. Subsequently, more realistic cases are considered by discussing the stability of ocean rings designed as ﬁts to an observed cold-core Gulf Stream ring and a warmcore Agulhas ring. Minimal growth rates for the latter rings are very large: the calculated e-folding timescales are about one week.},

  title = {\{\vphantom\}{{Hydrobiology}} of the {{Cochin}} Backwater System – a Review\vphantom\{\}},
  abstract = {On the south west coast of India, there is an extensive estuarine system of backwaters, of which Vembanad Lake is the largest. The backwaters of Kerala support as much biological productivity and diversity as tropical rain forests. They are responsible for the rich ﬁsheries potential of Kerala. Cochin backwaters situated at the tip of the northern Vembanad lake is a tropical positive estuarine system extending between 9◦ 40 and 10◦ 12 N and 76◦ 10’ and 76◦ 30 E with its northern boundary at Azheekode and southern boundary at Thannirmukham bund. The lake has a length of 80 km and the width varies between 500 and 4000 m. A channel, about 450 m wide at Cochin gut and another at Azheekode, make permanent connections with the Arabian Sea. The depth of the estuary varies considerably. While the shipping channels are maintained at a depth of 10–13 m, the major portion of the estuary has a depth range of 2–7 m. Water from two major rivers viz., Periyar and Muvattupuzha drain into this estuary. During south west monsoon, the estuary is virtually converted into a freshwater basin even in areas around barmouth where salt water penetration occurs below 5 m depth only. The major hydrological variable in the Cochin backwaters is salinity, similar to the situations encountered in estuaries with a gradual declension of salinity from 30 at the entrance of the estuary to 0.2 at the point of entry of the rivers. Salinity gradient in the Cochin backwaters supports diverse species of ﬂora and fauna depending on their capacity to tolerate oligohaline, mesohaline or marine conditions. Low lying swamps and tidal creeks, dominated by sparse patches of mangroves with their nutrient rich physical environment, support larvae and juveniles of many economically important species. Backwaters also act as nursery grounds of commercially important prawns and ﬁshes. The ﬁelds around the backwater are suitable for aquaculture. These areas support traditional, seasonal and perennial prawn ﬁshery. The changes in the hydrology controlled by the seasons play an important role in regulating the migrant fauna of the estuary. The Cochin backwater supports a well established endemic fauna. The nutrients and pollutants introduced into the estuary control to a great extent the distribution and abundance of less tolerant species in ecologically sensitive areas in the backwaters. Cochin backwaters, widely regarded as one of the polluted estuaries in India, receive contaminated freshwater inputs and discharges of efﬂuents and partially treated sewage from many points throughout its tidally mixed zone. Recently, changes brought about in the estuary like reclamation and consequent shrinkage of the backwaters and the discharge of pollutants have made an adverse impact on the potential of aquatic ecosystems that used to support high levels of bioproductivity and biodiversity. The construction of Thannirmukham bund and Thottapally spillway to prevent salt water penetration into the paddy ﬁelds during pre-monsoon has led to serious ecological problems by interrupting the natural ebb and ﬂow of tides. The hydrography, ﬂoral and faunal composition – its spatial and temporal variation plus assessments of the impact of the anthropogenic activities are presented in this review. An attempt to critically evaluate the status of the estuary from the biological and pollutional stand point is also done.},

In these limits, an alongshore wind drives enhanced onshelf transport in a coastal ocean if the shelf widens downwind, and the change in shelf width only affects the ﬂow in the direction of Kelvin wave propagation (‘‘downwave’’) from the change in shelf width. There is enhanced onshore transport of cold, nutrient-laden bottom water if the winds favor upwelling and the shelf narrows in the direction of Kelvin wave propagation. This enhanced transport extends a considerable distance away from the change in shelf width but becomes concentrated near the shelf break far from the change in width. Isobath curvature on the scale of the shelf width signiﬁcantly modiﬁes local cross-shelf transport. The cross-shelf transport of nutrient-rich water during upwelling is expected to be enhanced from Point Eugenia to La Jolla, San Luis Obispo to Monterey, and Point Reyes to Cape Mendocino on the west coast of North America.},

  abstract = {A hierarchy of hydrodynamical instabilities controlling the transfer of buoyancy through the oceanic mixed layer is reviewed. If a resting ocean of horizontally uniform stratiﬁcation is subject to spatially uniform buoyancy loss at the sea surface, then gravitational instability ensues in which buoyancy is drawn from depth by upright convection. But if spatial inhomogeneities in the ambient stratiﬁcation or the forcing are present (as always exist in nature), then horizontal density gradients will be induced and, within a rotation period, horizontal currents in thermal-wind balance with those gradients will be set up within the mixed layer. There are two important consequences on the convective process: 1) Upright convection will become modiﬁed by the presence of the thermal wind shear; ﬂuid parcels are exchanged not along vertical paths but, rather, along slanting paths in symmetric instability. Theoretical considerations suggest that this slantwise convection sets the potential vorticity of the mixed layer ﬂuid to zero but, in general, will leave it stably stratiﬁed in the vertical.},

  title = {Penetrative Convection in a Horizontal Layer of Seawater near Its Freezing Point},
  volume = {24},
  issn = {0307904X},
  abstract = {A series of numerical experiments are performed to investigate steady thermosolutal convection induced by the partial freezing of a horizontal pool of seawater from the top. This study is aimed at achieving a better understanding of the role of convection in transporting oceanic heat into the atmosphere during the formation of a polynya. The mathematical model considered accounts for the density anomaly of seawater and for the dependence of the freezing point on salinity. A new solutal regime is isolated wherein solutal convection is present even though the solutal expansion coecient is set to zero. This convection process arises as a result of the coupling between the ¯uctuations of temperature and salinity at the ice±water interface. A parametric study is undertaken as function of the main dimensionless groups characterizing the problem, namely the thermal Rayleigh number, the density ratio and an extremum parameter which quanti®es the eect of the nonlinear equation of state. Several indicators of the convection process, such as the Nusselt and Sherwood numbers, the kinetic energy in the ¯uid layer and the buoyancy are calculated. It is found that a two-layer convection regime generally predominates for relatively large Rayleigh numbers. These results imply that the penetrative convection which results from the coupling between the nonlinear equation of state and the freezing process acts in such a way as to delay the release of heat to the atmosphere during the formation of a polynya.

  title = {Why {{Anticyclones Can Split}}},
  volume = {33},
  abstract = {The question of whether anticyclones can split and break up is readdressed using a numerical, multilayer, primitive equation model. Applying the conservation of integrated angular momentum (IAM) to barotropic and baroclinic vortices, it has been argued that anticyclones can never split, no matter what their structure is. When an anticyclone splits, the IAM has to increase as the newly formed eddies are pushed away from their original center. Conservation of IAM prohibits such an increase. Several numerical simulations, however, have shown anticyclonic splitting. In a multilayer model, a vertical transport of IAM is possible. For counterrotating eddies (an anticyclone on top of a cyclone) it is easy to see that a vertical exchange of IAM allows the eddy to break up. For a compensated or weakly corotating eddy, breakup is only possible when, in addition to a vertical transport of IAM, in the deep layer(s) IAM is exchanged between the core of the vortex and the surrounding ﬂuid. In the presence of a tilting interface, the pressure gradient associated with the sea surface height (SSH) anomaly, in particular its non-equivalent-barotropic part, drives the required exchanges. The non-equivalentbarotropic SSH anomaly is associated with the vertical phase lag of the most unstable eigenmode (m ϭ 2), which develops when this mode gains energy by baroclinic energy conversion. The previous conclusion that anticyclones cannot split on their own should be revised to the following: anticyclones cannot split by barotropic processes alone—baroclinic instability is a necessary ingredient for splitting to occur.},

These profiles were obtained with a new instrument, GISMO, developed at the Oceanographic Institute, Gothenburg, Sweden. Typical circulation and mixing patterns were identified for "normal" southerly wind conditions and for northerly wind events, which occur regularly during the upwelling season. Strong events of shear intensification and related internal mixing were observed after a northerly wind event and interpreted in terms of passing internal Kelvin wave fronts. Nutrient flux into the surface layers due to this particular mixing mechanism may represent an important contribution for maintaining the tremendous biological production in the study area.},

  abstract = {Vertical proﬁles of horizontal currents and hydrographic measurements from three cruises along 80.5ЊE from the coast of Sri Lanka to 6ЊS between December 1990 and September 1994 are used to investigate the scales of the Indian Ocean deep jets as well as internal wave parameters and dissipation at the equator. The deep jets at 80.5ЊE have a vertical wavelength of 660 sm (stretched meters) and amplitudes exceeding 10 cm s Ϫ1 in zonal velocity. They are observed throughout the water column and their ﬂow direction reverses at 2Њ off the equator. The vertical positions of the jets differ among the cruises and are consistent with a ﬂow reversal between the data collected in winter and summer. During September 1994, the jets were less pronounced. Due to the meridional distribution of their zonal velocity and the phase relationship between zonal velocity and vertical displacement, the jets are best described as nondispersive ﬁrst-mode equatorial Rossby waves. The hydrographic data revealed thick layers of low stratiﬁcation with vertical scales of 15–55 m in the upper 2000 m of the water column. They are found primarily within 1Њ of the equator and there is some evidence of correlation between the vertical position as well as the extent and the high strain zones of the deep jets. At vertical wavenumbers larger than those of the deep jets, shear and strain levels are ﬁve times larger than at off-equatorial locations and the compliant internal wave range (‘‘roll-off range’’) begins at a smaller wavenumber (kc ഠ 0.02 cpsm). An estimate of the average dissipation rate within the deep jets yielded ⑀ ϭ 7.5 ϫ 10Ϫ10 W kgϪ1 between 500- and 2000m depth. The elevated ﬁnescale internal wave ﬁeld appears to be the main cause for the existence of the low stratiﬁcation layers.},

  title = {Deep Ocean Exchange with West-{{European}} Shelf Seas},
  abstract = {We review mechanisms and studies of exchange between the north-east Atlantic and the adjacent shelf seas. Well-developed summer upwelling and associated ﬁlaments off Portugal and north-west Spain give exchange O(3 m2/s per unit length of shelf). Prevailing westerly winds further north drive exchange O(1 m2/s). Poleward ﬂow along most of the upper slope has associated secondary circulation O(1 m2/s), meanders and eddies. Eddies are shed from slope waters into the Bay of Biscay, and local exchanges occur at shelf spurs and depressions or canyons (e.g. dense-water cascading of order 1 m2/s). Tidal transports are larger, but their reversal every six hours makes exchange largely ineffective except where internal tides are large and non-linear, as in the Celtic Sea where solitons carry water with exchange O(1 m2/s). These various physical exchanges amount to an estimated 2–3 m2/s per unit length of shelf, between ocean and shelf. A numerical model estimate is comparable: 2.5×106 m3/s onto and off the shelf from Brittany to Norway. Mixing controls the seasonal thermocline, affecting primary production and hence ﬂuxes and fate of organic matter. Speciﬁcally, CO2 take-up by primary production, settling below the thermocline before respiration, and then off-shelf transport, make an effective shelf-sea “pump” (for CO2 from the atmosphere to the deep ocean). However, knowledge of biogeochemical ﬂuxes is generally sparse, giving scope for more measurements, model validation and estimates from models.},

Swimmers - or other intruders - that agitate the bed too rapidly produce large voids that prevent traction from being achieved, while swimmers that move too slowly cannot travel before the bed re-solidiﬁes around them i.e., the swimmers locally probe the fundamental time-scale in a granular packing.},

  volume = {90},
  abstract = {Climate change arising due to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere since the pre-industrial times has emerged as a serious global environmental issue and poses a threat and challenge to mankind. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change enjoins upon the Parties to the Convention to protect the climate system according to their common but differentiated responsibilities. The parties to the convention are also required to report to the convention on a regular basis a comprehensive and comparable inventory of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and the steps taken to protect the climate. Towards the fulfillment of its obligations, India submitted its initial national communication to the UNFCCC in June 2004. This paper analyses the improvements made in greenhouse gases (GHG) inventory estimation reported in the Initial National Communication with respect to the earlier published estimates and highlights the strengths, the gaps that still exist and the future challenges for inventory refinement. An assessment of the current and projected trends of GHG emission from India and some selected countries indicates that though Indian emissions grew at the rate of 4 per cent per annum during 1990 and 2000 period and are projected to grow further to meet the national developmental needs, the absolute level of GHG emissions in 2020 will be below 5 per cent of global emissions and the per capita emissions will still be low compared to most of the developed countries as well as the global average.},

  volume = {33},
  abstract = {Numerical experiments are carried out on the f plane, using a shallow-water isopycnal model, to analyze the behavior of a surface-intensiﬁed anticyclonic vortex when it encounters an isolated seamount. The advection by the vortex of deep ﬂuid parcels across the isobaths is known to generate deep anticyclonic and cyclonic circulations above and near the bathymetry, respectively. These circulations are shown to exert a strong shear on the upper layers, which causes an erosion of the initial vortex by ﬁlamentation. The erosion often results in a subdivision of the eddy. While the eroded original structure forms a dipole with the deep cyclone and is advected away, the ﬁlaments torn off from the original core aggregate into a new eddy above the seamount. Splitting in more than two structures is sometimes observed. The erosion process is quantiﬁed by the bulk volume integral of the eddy potential vorticity anomaly. A sensitivity study to different parameters of the conﬁguration (distance between vortex and seamount, vortex radius, seamount radius, seamount height, or stratiﬁcation) shows that the intensities of the deep anticyclonic and cyclonic circulations and the vortex erosion are governed both by the reservoir of positive potential vorticity associated with the seamount and by the strength of the cross-isobath ﬂow induced by the eddy.},

  shorttitle = {Hear Where We Are},
  abstract = {Throughout history, hearing and sound perception have been typically framed in the context of how sound conveys information and how that information influences the listener. Hear Where We Are inverts this premise and examines how humans and other hearing animals use sound to establish acoustical relationships with their surroundings. This simple inversion reveals a panoply of possibilities by which we can re-evaluate how hearing animals use, produce, and perceive sound. Nuance in vocalizations become signals of enticement or boundary setting; silence becomes a field ripe in auditory possibilities; predator/prey relationships are infused with acoustic deception, and sounds that have been considered territorial cues become the fabric of cooperative acoustical communities. This inversion also expands the context of sound perception into a larger perspective that centers on biological adaptation within acoustic habitats. Here, the rapid synchronized flight patterns of flocking birds and the tight maneuvering of schooling fish becomes an acoustic engagement. Likewise, when stridulating crickets synchronize their summer evening chirrups, it has more to do with the cricket community monitoring their collective boundaries rather than individual crickets establishing personal territory or breeding fitness. In Hear Where We Are the author continuously challenges many of the bio-acoustic orthodoxies, reframing the entire inquiry into sound perception and communication. By moving beyond our common assumptions, many of the mysteries of acoustical behavior become revealed, exposing a fresh and fertile panorama of acoustical experience and adaptation. Praise for Hear Where We Are: Hear Where We Are is as poetic as it is informative - in the tradition of some of the best scientific writing." Julia Whitty, Author, Deep Blue Home: An Intimate Ecology of Our Wild Ocean Hear Where We Are opens up an entirely new way of understanding not only sound perception but our place within the world I no longer just hear my surroundings, rather I am now aware of how deeply sound shapes my relationship to the world around me...

  abstract = {A reinterpretation of the life history of warm core ring 82-B is constructed from drifter trajectories, hydrographicprofiles, and satellite-derivedsea surface temperature fields. An analysisof the observationsstrongly suggeststhis ring is fundamentally a dipole structure for much of its existence. The dipole has unequal strengthvortices, with the cyclone being the weaker component. Quantification of the dipole indicatesthe anticycloneis oval shapedand rotates at approximately 7.7øper day, while the cyclone revolves around the anticyclone at about 14.5øper day, yielding an orbit period of approximately 25 days for the cyclone. The elusive part of the dipole explanationis in interpreting its surface signatureas a function of time, as the cyclone appearsto disappearwhen in proximity to the steepcontinental slope. Vortex modeling suggeststhat when the weaker cyclonic eddy is placed close to a boundary, the cyclone is drawn into a filament as it is advected through the gap between the anticyclone and the boundary. This means the cyclone is either in a filamentation state or undergoingthe strainingassociatedwith filamentation approximately three fourths of the time, which is in complete agreement with the satellite imagery.

  abstract = {It is shown that wind stress curl is balanced by bottom pressure torque in a zonal integral over any strip wide enough to smooth out the effect of nonlinear terms (typically about 3Њ of latitude). The derivation is completely general as long as the zonal wind stress is balanced by form stress at each latitude, as is known to be the case in the ocean. This implies that viscous torques are not important in western boundary currents, their place being taken by bottom pressure torques. The prediction is conﬁrmed in the context of a global, eddy-permitting, numerical ocean model. This link between form stress and bottom pressure torques makes it easier to consider Southern Ocean dynamics and subtropical gyre dynamics in the same conceptual framework, with topographic interactions being important in both cases.},

Attention is focused on two cases: a step-down case in which the depth beyond the step (looking downstream) is infinite, and a step-up case in which the downstream depth is finite. Before examining these two cases in detail, the step matching conditions, analogous to the so-called Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for shock waves, are derived. These derivations show that, in contrast to our expectations, the sea-level on the two sides of the step should not necessarily be matched. On the basis of the newly derived step conditions, steady solutions for the step-down case are obtained analytically by considering the conservation of potential vorticity and mass, the Bernoulli integral and the integrated momentum equation. These solutions are constructed by connecting the upstream and downstream fields without solving for the complicated region in between.},

This approach is based on the application of neural network (NN) techniques. It can be used to accelerate the calculations and improve the accuracy of the parameterizations of several types of physical processes which generally require computations involving complex mathematical expressions, including diﬀerential and integral equations, rules, restrictions and highly nonlinear empirical relations based on physical or statistical models. It is shown that, from a mathematical point of view, such parameterizations can usually be considered as continuous mappings (continuous dependencies between two vectors). It is also shown that NNs are a generic tool for fast and accurate approximation of continuous mappings and, therefore, can be used to replace primary parameterization algorithms. In addition to fast and accurate approximation of the primary parameterization, NN also provides the entire Jacobian for very little computation cost.},

Considerationof each term in isolation is misleading and there can be a large degree of cancellation.On the other hand, in Sutcliffe's development theory, this forcing is, in effect, represented by a single term. However, this is achieved at theexpense of neglecting another term which is dominant in frontal regions. An investigation, based upon the governing equations, of the manner in which geostrophic balance tends to destroy itself, reveals a simple, concise, one-term representation of the geostrophicforcing of ageostrophic motion. Many of the traditional synoptic rules are then simple deductions from this theory. An application of the theory in the case of a rapidly developing system is demonstrated using a 700mb chart.},

The land–sea contrast in surface temperature was considered the primary mechanism that drives the monsoon. During the last 47 years a large amount of data has been obtained from satellites and this has altered our perception about the factors that influence monsoon rainfall. The satellite data has revealed that the clouds in the tropics move eastward along the equator and poleward from the equator to higher latitudes. The net radiant energy available to earth–atmosphere system was found to be a fundamental driving force for monsoon rainfall. The role played by water vapour in controlling vertical stability, latent heat of condensation and greenhouse effect was appreciated better after the advent of satellite data.},

We demonstrate that surface wettability is an unexpected key factor in controlling flow separation and dripping, the latter being completely suppressed in the limit of superhydrophobic substrates. This unforeseen coupling is rationalized in terms of a novel hydro-capillary adhesion framework, which couples inertial flows to surface wettability effects. This description of flow separation successfully captures the observed dependence on the various experimental parameters - wettability, flow velocity, solid surface edge curvature-. As a further illustration of this coupling, a real-time control of dripping is demonstrated using electro-wetting for contact angle actuation.},

This study is motivated by several recent observational studies that ﬁnd that subsurface ﬂoats injected near the western boundary of the Labrador Sea most often do not continuously follow the deep western boundary current (DWBC), in contrast to the traditional view that the deep water formed in the North Atlantic predominantly follows the DWBC. It is found that, with imposed large viscosity values, the model reproduces the traditional view. However, as viscosity is reduced and the model bathymetry resolution increased, much of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) separates from the western boundary and enters the low-latitude Atlantic via interior pathways distinct from the DWBC. It is shown that bottom pressure torques play an important role in maintaining these interior NADW outﬂows.},

Primary attention is on the relationship between the above forcing and the resultant dynamics (currents), the further issue of the interconnected impacts on turbulence, mixing, and stratification is described more fully in Chapters 2.02 and 2.05. In comparison with the primary forcing components, the energy content of these residual circulations may seem negligible. However, such circulations strongly influence the longer-term supply to and disposal from estuaries of salt, heat, sediments, nutrients, etc. While the associated horizontal distribution patterns clearly influence these exchanges, the vertical distributions of temperature and salinity generate significant density gradients that often result in opposing export and import of tracers between the surface and bed.},

How can one meaningfully interpret the inferred rates of upwelling and diffusion ? The annual freezing of 2.1 x 10to g of Antarctic pack ice is associated with bottom water formation in the ratio 43 : 1, yielding an estimated 4 × 10:0g year-t of Pacific bottom water; the value w = 1"2 cm day-t implies 6 x 10\textasciitilde{}0g year-L I have attempted, without much success, to interpret x from a variety of viewpoints: from mixing along the ocean boundaries, from thermodynamic and biological processes, and from internal tides. Following the work of Cox and SA,'qr\textasciitilde{}STROM(1962), it is found that surface tides are scattered by the irregular bottom into internal modes with an associated energy flux of 4 x 10-\textasciitilde{} ergs g-\textasciitilde{} see-: (one sixth the total tidal dissipation). Such internal modes can produce shear instability in the Richardson sense. It is found that internal tides provide a marginal but not impossible me:hanism for turbulent diffusion in the interior oceans.},

  issn = {0022-3670, 1520-0485},
  abstract = {The dynamics of a quasigeostrophic ﬂow conﬁned in a two-layer channel over variable topography on the beta plane is numerically investigated. The topography slopes uniformly upward in the north–south direction (in the beta sense) and is a smooth function of the zonal coordinate. The bottom slope controls the local supercriticality and is conﬁgured to destabilize the ﬂow only in a central interval of limited zonal extent. Linearized solutions indicate that, for a wide enough channel, unstable modes exist for an arbitrary short interval of instability, conﬁrming previous analysis on disturbances with no meridional variation. For small local maximum supercriticality, the instability is maintained by a short bottom-trapped wave localized at the downstream edge of the unstable region and oscillating in phase with the upper-layer disturbance. When nonlinearity is retained in the problem, the equilibration of the bottom-trapped wave is associated with the formation of coherent vortices. Both cyclones and anticyclones are formed continuously at the northeastern edge of the unstable interval. Through vortex stretching mechanisms, dipoles inside the interval of instability can split upon reaching the northern wall: Anticyclones move downstream along the north wall and propagate into the downstream stable region, while cyclonic structures tend to remain trapped inside the interval of instability. The authors suggest the relevance of their results to the observed eddy ﬁeld of the Labrador Sea.},

The inferred patterns of Q vary with density, the basin, and hemisphere. At middepths, the distribution of Q is controlled by the background planetary vorticity gradient. On deeper isopycnals, there are regions where Q contours deviate from latitude circles and even regions of nearly uniform Q. These different regimes appear to be robust features over the interior of ocean basins, as the standard error is found to be relatively small there. The nearly uniform Q occurs in the deep waters of the North Paciﬁc and, possibly, in the bottom waters of the western North Atlantic and North Paciﬁc. The nearly uniform Q has a low magnitude in each case, as well as a relatively low variability for the deep waters of the North Paciﬁc. This nearly uniform Q signal appears to be formed when a single water mass enters the basin from a low latitude source.},

  shorttitle = {The {{KPP}} Boundary Layer Scheme},
  abstract = {We evaluate the Community ocean Vertical Mixing (CVMix) project version of the K-profile parameterization (KPP). For this purpose, one-dimensional KPP simulations are compared across a suite of oceanographically relevant regimes against large eddy simulations (LES). The LES is forced with horizontally uniform boundary fluxes and has horizontally uniform initial conditions, allowing its horizontal average to be compared to one-dimensional KPP tests. We find the standard configuration of KPP consistent with LES across many forcing regimes, supporting the physical basis of KPP. Our evaluation motivates recommendations for "best practices" for using KPP within ocean circulation models, and identifies areas where further research is warranted. Further, our test suite can be used as a baseline for evaluation of a broad suite of boundary layer models. The original treatment of KPP recommends the matching of interior diffusivities and their gradients to the KPP predicted values computed in the ocean surface boundary layer (OSBL). However, we find that difficulties in representing derivatives of rapidly changing diffusivities near the base of the OSBL can lead to loss of simulation fidelity. We propose two alternative approaches. We find the KPP entrainment buoyancy flux to be sensitive to vertical grid resolution and details of how to diagnose the KPP boundary layer depth. We modify the KPP turbulent shear velocity parameterization to reduce resolution dependence. Additionally, our results show that the KPP parameterized non-local tracer flux is incomplete due to the assumption that it solely redistributes the surface tracer flux. However, examination of the LES vertical turbulent scalar flux budgets show that non-local fluxes can exist in the absence of surface tracer fluxes. This result motivates further studies of the non-local flux parameterization.},

  abstract = {The summertime intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) is an important component of the south Asian monsoon. Lagged regressions of intraseasonally filtered (25–80 days) outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) reveal that centers of convection move both northward and eastward from the central equatorial Indian Ocean subsequent to the initiation of an ISO. Eastward movement of convection is also seen at Indian subcontinent latitudes (10°–20°N). Based on the regression results, the summertime ISO convection signal appears as a band tilting northwestward with latitude and stretching from the equator to about 20°N. Viewed along any meridian, convection appears to propagate northward while equatorial convection propagates to the east. To examine the robustness of the connection between eastward and northward movement, individual ISOs are categorized and composited relative to the strength of the large-scale eastward component of convection in the central equatorial Indian Ocean. It is found that the majority of ISOs that exhibit northward movement onto the Indian subcontinent (42 out of 54 ISOs, or 78\%) also exhibit eastward movement into the western Pacific Ocean. It is also found that when convection in the central Indian Ocean is not followed within 10–20 days by convection in the western Pacific Ocean (12 out of 54 ISOs, or 22\%), the independent northward movement of convection in the Indian Ocean region is somewhat stunted. The link between the eastward and northward movement of convection is consistent with an interpretation of the summertime ISO in terms of propagating equatorial modes. The northward moving portion of convection is forced by surface frictional convergence into the low pressure center of the Rossby cell that is excited by equatorial ISO convection. A similar convergence pattern is seen for the northern winter ISO, but it does not generate poleward movement due to relatively cool SSTs underlying the surface convergence.},

  abstract = {The Bay of Bengal receives large amounts of freshwater from the Ganga-Brahmaputra (GB) river during the summer monsoon. The resulting upper-ocean freshening influences seasonal rainfall, cyclones, and biological productivity. Sparse in situ observations and previous modeling studies suggest that the East India Coastal Current (EICC) transports these freshwaters southward after the monsoon as an approximately 200 km wide, 2,000 km long “river in the sea” along the East Indian coast. Sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite provides unprecedented views of this peculiar feature from intraseasonal to interannual timescales. SMAP SSS has a 0.83 correlation and 0.49 rms-difference to 0–5 m in situ measurements. SMAP and in stu data both indicate a SSS standard deviation of ∼0.7 to 1 away from the coast, that rises to 2 pss within 100 km of the coast, providing a very favorable signal-to-noise ratio in coastal areas. SMAP also captures the strong northern BoB, postmonsoon cross-shore SSS contrasts (∼10 pss) measured along ship transects. SMAP data are also consistent with previous modeling results that suggested a modulation of the EICC/GB plume southward extent by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Remote forcing associated with the negative Indian Ocean Dipole in the fall of 2016 indeed caused a stronger EICC and “river in the sea” that extended by approximately 800 km further south than that in 2015 (positive IOD year). The combination of SMAP and altimeter data shows eddies stirring the freshwater plume away from the coast.},

The dominant transient modes of the wave number frequency spectra of surface pressure along the latitudes of the monsoon trough (i.e., 20° to 30°N) are determined from a longitude-time composite of roughly 3 months of surface pressure data for ten separate episodes of Breaks in the monsoons. This data base is composited relative to a reference (0, 0) which denotes the day of commencement of the Break in rainfall over central India and the longitude of central India (i.e., 75O E). These dominant modes, as determined from this cornposited data, exhibit interesting westward as well as eastward propagating modes. Furthermore, some of the salient modes exhibit steady variations of phase from one day to the next. The period of Breaks in the monsoon rainfall is shown to coincide with a pressure rise associated with the arrival of a ridge of the dominant modes over the reference origin (0, 0). The remaining 30 years of data are next subjected to a test of a hypothesis that the steady propagation of phase of a dominant westward propagating mode can be used to extrapolate, and thus to predict, the arrival of this ridge. The tests show that a 10-day linear extrapolationof the phase to Day 0 exhibits considerable skill in locating the ridge of the “Monsoon Breaks” over central India. In over 70\% of the cases examined we note that the arrival of the ridge coincides with a period of the observed Breaks in the monsoon. Suggestions for casting this problem in a truly predictive frame are made, the results of which will be reported in a separate study.},

  abstract = {Satellite salinity from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and in situ observations are used to diagnose the source of a significant increase in warm and salty surface water entering the Gulf of Maine (GoM) in the winter of 2017–2018. SMAP salinity anomaly data indicate that this event was related to a salty feature that moved along the northwestern Atlantic shelf break from near the Grand Banks southwest towards the GoM over eight months before entering the Gulf in December 2017 to January 2018. Satellite altimetry, sea surface salinity, and sea surface temperature data suggest that, before entering the GoM, the salty feature interacted with Gulf Stream meanders and eddies several times, helping to sustain the water mass. It is likely that feature interactions with a warm Gulf Stream meander took place in the fall of 2017, helping to advect high salinity water onto the shelf and then into the GoM as a surface trapped feature in late fall 2017. According to satellite salinity data, this episode led to significant salinification (about 1 psu) in the northeastern GoM. Interior GoM buoy salinity data agree in showing four months of increased GoM salinity of the upper 50 m starting in November 2017. Buoy T/S analyses characterize this surface inflow as modified warm Atlantic slope water, typically seen only below 100 m and previously unobserved at the surface in the 15-year buoy record. This new salty water circulated cyclonically along the GoM coastline and mixed into the deeper Gulf through February 2018. Its intrusion may have also enhanced the cyclonic winter circulation in the Gulf. GoM surface salinity anomalies ended abruptly in early March 2018 coincident with the occurrence of a bomb cyclone and its associated strong upper ocean mixing.},

The results suggest that thermocline mixing in the North Pacific LLWBC is generally weak with the diapycnal diffusivity κρ∼O(10−6) m2 s−1. This is consistent with predictions from internal wave-wave interaction theory that mixing due to internal wave breaking is significantly reduced at low latitudes. Enhanced mixing is found to be associated with a permanent cyclonic eddy, the Mindanao Eddy, but mainly at its south and north flanks. There, κρ is elevated by an order of magnitude due to eddy-induced geostrophic shear. Mixing in the eddy core is at the background level with no indication of enhancement.},

  issn = {09670645},
  abstract = {The Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillations (MISO) is known to be strongly coupled to the upper ocean variability in the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Here, we analyze highresolution moored observations from the northern BoB (18 °N, in comparison with an array of moorings to the south along 90 °E (8, 12, and 15 °N) to examine the observed temperature and salinity variability during the 2015 summer monsoon season. The heat budget analysis indicates that the mixed-layer (ML) temperature tendency at 18 °N in late summer (August and September) deviated greatly from the tendency that is expected based on surface heat ﬂux alone. Examination of moored ML salinity and satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) ﬁelds suggests that southward extension of riverine freshwater plumes to the mooring site in late summer plays an important role in modulating the heat balance. The associated shoaling of the ML results in enhanced penetrative heat loss and warming beneath the surface layer. Price-Weller-Pinkel (PWP) 1-D model simulations, which account for vertical mixing, suggest that the entrainment of this subsurface warm water under monsoon wind improves closure of the temperature balance. Long-term analysis of satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall data indicates that late summer ML shoaling is accompanied by ampliﬁed intraseasonal (10–60 day) SST variability and reduced MISO precipitation variability. Overall, these results demonstrate the critical importance of freshwater plumes to improved understanding of the upper-ocean heat budget and air-sea interaction in the BoB.},

  issn = {0894-8755, 1520-0442},
  abstract = {New features that may affect the behavior of the upper ocean in the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) are described. In particular, the addition of an idealized diurnal cycle of solar forcing where the daily mean solar radiation received in each daily coupling interval is distributed over 12 daylight hours is evaluated. The motivation for this simple diurnal cycle is to improve the behavior of the upper ocean, relative to the constant forcing over each day of previous CCSM versions. Both 1- and 3-h coupling intervals are also considered as possible alternatives that explicitly resolve the diurnal cycle of solar forcing. The most prominent and robust effects of all these diurnal cycles are found in the tropical oceans, especially in the Pacific. Here, the mean equatorial sea surface temperature (SST) is warmed by as much as 1°C, in better agreement with observations, and the mean boundary layer depth is reduced. Simple rectification of the diurnal cycle explains about half of the shallowing, but less than 0.1°C of the warming. The atmospheric response to prescribed warm SST anomalies of about 1°C displays a very different heat flux signature. The implication, yet to be verified, is that large-scale air–sea coupling is a prime mechanism for amplifying the rectified, daily averaged SST signals seen by the atmosphere. Although the use of upper-layer temperature for SST in CCSM3 underestimates the diurnal cycle of SST, many of the essential characteristics of diurnal cycling within the equatorial ocean are reproduced, including boundary layer depth, currents, and the parameterized vertical heat and momentum fluxes associated with deep-cycle turbulence. The conclusion is that the implementation of an idealized diurnal cycle of solar forcing may make more frequent ocean coupling and its computational complications unnecessary as improvements to the air–sea coupling in CCSM3 continue. A caveat here is that more frequent ocean coupling tends to reduce the long-term cooling trends typical of CCSM3 by heating already too warm ocean depths, but longer integrations are needed to determine robust features. A clear result is that the absence of diurnal solar forcing of the ocean has several undesirable consequences in CCSM3, including too large ENSO variability, much too cold Pacific equatorial SST, and no deep-cycle turbulence.},

  abstract = {The ocean component of the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) is described, and its solutions from the twentieth-century (20C) simulations are documented in comparison with observations and those of CCSM3. The improvements to the ocean model physical processes include new parameterizations to represent previously missing physics and modiﬁcations of existing parameterizations to incorporate recent new developments. In comparison with CCSM3, the new solutions show some signiﬁcant improvements that can be attributed to these model changes. These include a better equatorial current structure, a sharper thermocline, and elimination of the cold bias of the equatorial cold tongue all in the Paciﬁc Ocean; reduced sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity biases along the North Atlantic Current path; and much smaller potential temperature and salinity biases in the near-surface Paciﬁc Ocean. Other improvements include a global-mean SST that is more consistent with the present-day observations due to a different spinup procedure from that used in CCSM3. Despite these improvements, many of the biases present in CCSM3 still exist in CCSM4. A major concern continues to be the substantial heat content loss in the ocean during the preindustrial control simulation from which the 20C cases start. This heat loss largely reﬂects the top of the atmospheric model heat loss rate in the coupled system, and it essentially determines the abyssal ocean potential temperature biases in the 20C simulations. There is also a deep salty bias in all basins. As a result of this latter bias in the deep North Atlantic, the parameterized overﬂow waters cannot penetrate much deeper than in CCSM3.},

  abstract = {Fine- and micro-structure observations indicate that turbulent mixing is enhanced within O(1) km above rough topography. Enhanced mixing is associated with internal wave breaking and, in many regions of the ocean, has been linked to the breaking and dissipation of internal tides. The generation and dissipation of internal tides are explored in this study using a high-resolution two-dimensional nonhydrostatic numerical model, which explicitly resolves the instabilities leading to wave breaking, conﬁgured in an idealized domain with a realistic multiscale topography and ﬂow characteristics. The control simulation, chosen to represent the Brazil Basin region, produces a vertical proﬁle of energy dissipation and temporal characteristics of ﬁnescale motions that are consistent with observations. Results suggest that a signiﬁcant fraction of mixing in the bottom O(1) km of the ocean is sustained by the transfer of energy from the large-scale internal tides to smaller-scale internal waves by nonlinear wave–wave interactions. The time scale of the energy transfer to the smaller scales is estimated to be on the order of a few days. A suite of sensitivity experiments is carried out to examine the dependence of the energy transfer time scale and energy dissipation on topographic roughness, tidal amplitude, and Coriolis frequency parameters. Implications for tidal mixing parameterizations are discussed.},

  abstract = {The Garrett–Munk (GM) spectrum continues to be a useful description of the oceanic internal wave ﬁeld. However, there are several inconsistencies and ambiguities that make it difﬁcult to use in comparing internal wave ﬁelds at different latitudes, stratiﬁcations, and water depths. A modiﬁed spectral formulation is presented that treats three problems with the Garrett–Munk formulation: the normalization of the energy spectrum as a function of frequency bandwidth, the energy distribution at frequencies below the semidiurnal tide, and the treatment of vertical boundaries and turning points. Addressing these problems leads to a substitution of the GM parameters E (nondimensional energy), b (vertical length scale), and N0 (buoyancy frequency scale) with two new dimensional scales: Eref, the energy per unit mass, and D(␻), the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB)scaled thickness of the vertical waveguide. The advantages of the modiﬁed spectrum are illustrated by comparing with observations from the equator and the continental shelf.},

These data have been used to estimate vertical isotherm displacements at hourly intervals, yielding a global measure of the heaving due to internal gravity waves. The displacement results have been employed to examine the global variability of these waves and how the displacement power spectrum compares to the canonical Garrett–Munk spectrum. Using the data, the authors ﬁnd correlations between internal wave intensity and seaﬂoor roughness, proximity to the seaﬂoor, and the magnitude of the local barotropic velocity. The measurements also show large seamount-trapped waves at high latitudes and coastally trapped subinertial waves. These observations provide a rough global census of the nature of these waves that can ultimately be used in studies of ocean mixing.},

  abstract = {Finescale estimates of diapycnal diffusivity k are computed from CTD and expendable CTD (XCTD) data sampled in Drake Passage and in the eastern Paciﬁc sector of the Southern Ocean and are compared against microstructure measurements from the same times and locations. The microstructure data show vertical diffusivities that are one-third to one-ﬁfth as large over the smooth abyssal plain in the southeastern Paciﬁc as they are in Drake Passage, where diffusivities are thought to be enhanced by the ﬂow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current over rough topography. Finescale methods based on vertical strain estimates are successful at capturing the spatial variability between the low-mixing regime in the southeastern Paciﬁc and the high-mixing regime of Drake Passage. Thorpe-scale estimates for the same dataset fail to capture the differences between Drake Passage and eastern Paciﬁc estimates. XCTD proﬁles have lower vertical resolution and higher noise levels after ﬁltering than CTD proﬁles, resulting in XCTD k estimates that are, on average, an order of magnitude higher than CTD estimates. Overall, microstructure diffusivity estimates are better matched by strain-based estimates than by estimates based on Thorpe scales, and CTD data appear to perform better than XCTD data. However, even the CTD-based strain diffusivity estimates can differ from microstructure diffusivities by nearly an order of magnitude, suggesting that density-based ﬁne-structure methods of estimating mixing from CTD or XCTD data have real limitations in low-stratiﬁcation regimes such as the Southern Ocean.},

An analysis indicates that the results have an error of at most 0.3 x l0 t 5W and that contributions due to the eddy heat flux and seasonal variation are relatively small. The variation of mean meridional volume transport with depth at 25"N has been computed; the profile leads to the estimate of transport in various temperature classes and to some conclusions concerning the mechanisms of heat flux. The freshwater flux at 25°N has been computed; within error it is zero, a result that agrees with the literature.},

  issn = {0894-8755, 1520-0442},
  abstract = {Turbulent mixing driven by breaking internal tides plays a primary role in the meridional overturning and oceanic heat budget. Most current climate models explicitly parameterize only the local dissipation of internal tides at the generation sites, representing the remote dissipation of low-mode internal tides that propagate away through a uniform background diffusivity. In this study, a simple energetically consistent parameterization of the low-mode internal-tide dissipation is derived and implemented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model with GOLD component (GFDL-ESM2G). The impact of remote and local internal-tide dissipation on the ocean state is examined using a series of simulations with the same total amount of energy input for mixing, but with different scalings of the vertical proﬁle of dissipation with the stratiﬁcation and with different idealized scenarios for the distribution of the low-mode internal-tide energy dissipation: uniformly over ocean basins, continental slopes, or continental shelves. In these idealized scenarios, the ocean state, including the meridional overturning circulation, ocean ventilation, main thermocline thickness, and ocean heat uptake, is particularly sensitive to the vertical distribution of mixing by breaking low-mode internal tides. Less sensitivity is found to the horizontal distribution of mixing, provided that distribution is in the open ocean. Mixing on coastal shelves only impacts the large-scale circulation and water mass properties where it modiﬁes water masses originating on shelves. More complete descriptions of the distribution of the remote part of internal-tide-driven mixing, particularly in the vertical and relative to water mass formation regions, are therefore required to fully parameterize ocean turbulent mixing.},

  abstract = {In September 2003, microstructure and ﬁne-scale shear (vertical derivative of horizontal current) and strain (vertical derivative of isopycnal displacements) proﬁles were collected in Storfjorden, Svalbard Archipelago. Storfjorden is a sillfjord of signiﬁcant dense water production and the period of observations corresponds to weak overﬂow conditions of the dense water. The data set comprises ﬁne-scale measurements combined with simultaneous dissipation and buoyancy frequency proﬁles and allows for evaluation of various turbulence scalings and internal wave–wave interaction models. Microstructure proﬁles identiﬁed high levels of background vertical diffusivity, Kr, O(10À4) m2 sÀ1, which increased by one order within the overﬂow. Fine-scale shear and strain spectral levels were found to be elevated above those of Garrett–Munk, consistent with the observed enhanced mixing, whereas their average ratio was comparable to that of Garrett–Munk. Among the internal wave–wave interaction models, a shear–strain model agreed with the observations (between the surface and bottom mixed layers) within a factor of 2, on the average. A scaling of the dissipation, e, in the form of total-energy Â N suggests that approximately 0.5\% of the energy is dissipated per buoyancy period, 2p/N. The best-ﬁt power-law scaling between diffusivity and N is KrpNÀ1.4 (70.2). For this environment, a parameterization of the form of Pacanowski–Philander is suggested with background levels of eddy viscosity and diffusivity elevated by an order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {In the stratiﬁed ocean, vertical motions arise from both adiabatic and diabatic mechanisms. Diapycnal advection is the vertical component of ﬂow across an isopycnal surface which occurs when mixing produces a divergent ﬂux of buoyancy. Buoyancy forcing of the lateral ﬂow by vortex stretching occurs when diapycnal advection rates vary with depth. Microstructure observations of enhanced turbulence above rough topography are presented. These data allow us to distinguish the inﬂuence of diabatic forcing on the circulation. Estimates of diapycnal advection are used to quantify the diabatic ﬂow, and the role of diapycnal advection as a mechanism of vortex stretching on the circulation is assessed. The divergence of diapycnal mass ﬂux is found to be a signiﬁcant forcing mechanism for the circulation occurring above fracture zone topography. Moreover, both the direction and magnitude of diapycnal advection are dependent on the eﬃciency of turbulence at generating a buoyancy ﬂux. Depth variations of diapycnal advection suggest the mixing eﬃciency is reduced in weakly stratiﬁed abyssal canyons.},

The highly sheared and stratiﬁed transition layer at the mixed-layer base varies between 5 m and 35 m and correlates negatively with the wind stress. Results from the mixed layer near-inertial KE (NIKE) balance suggest that wind energy at times can energize the transition layer and at other times is fully utilized within the mixed layer. A simple two layer model is utilized to study the shear evolution in the transition layer and shown to match well with observations. The shear production in this model arises from alignment of wind stress and shear. Although the winds are unidirectional during the monsoon, the shear in the transition layer is predominantly near-inertial. The near-inertial shear bursts in the observations show the same phasing and magnitude at near-inertial frequencies as the wind-shear alignment term.},

The time-mean kinetic energy and shear vertical wavenumber spectra of the high-frequency motions at the mooring site are in reasonable agreement with the Garrett–Munk internal wave description. Time series of depth-dependent and depthintegrated near-inertial kinetic energy are calculated from available mooring data after ﬁltering to isolate near-inertial-frequency motions. These data document a pronounced seasonal cycle featuring a wintertime maximum in the depth-integrated near-inertial kinetic energy deriving chieﬂy from the variability in the upper 500 m of the water column. The seasonal signal in the near-inertial kinetic energy is most prominent for motions with vertical wavelengths greater than 100 m but observable wintertime enhancement is seen down to wavelengths of the order of 10 m. Rotary vertical wavenumber spectra exhibit a dominance of clockwisewith-depth energy, indicative of downward energy propagation and implying a surface energy source. A simple depth-integrated near-inertial kinetic energy model consisting of a wind forcing term and a dissipation term captures the order of magnitude of the observed near-inertial kinetic energy as well as its seasonal cycle.},

  issn = {0022-3670, 1520-0485},
  abstract = {This paper describes the occurrence of diurnal restratiﬁcation events found in the southeast trade wind regime off northern Chile. This is a region where persistent marine stratus clouds are found and where there is a less than complete understanding of the dynamics that govern the maintenance of the sea surface temperature. A surface mooring deployed in the region provides surface meteorological, air–sea ﬂux, and upperocean temperature, salinity, and velocity data. In the presence of steady southeast trade winds and strong evaporation, a warm, salty surface mixed layer is found in the upper ocean. During the year, these trade winds, at times, drop dramatically and surface heating leads to the formation of shallow, warm diurnal mixed layers over one to several days. At the end of such a low wind period, mean sea surface temperature is warmer. Though magnitudes of the individual diurnal warming events are consistent with local forcing, as judged by running a one-dimensional model, the net warming at the end of a low wind event is more difﬁcult to predict. This is found to stem from differences between the observed and predicted near-inertial shear and the depths over which the warmed water is distributed. As a result, the evolution of SST has a dependency on these diurnal restratiﬁcation events and on near-surface processes that govern the depth over which the heat gained during such events is distributed.},

  issn = {0739-0572, 1520-0426},
  abstract = {A new autonomous and moored microstructure measuring instrument has been tested in coastal waters. The instrument measures shear in the dissipation range of the wavenumber spectrum using four shear probes; temperature ﬂuctuations using two FP-07 thermistors; temperature and salinity using three pairs of Seabird sensors; horizontal currents using two ducted rotors and a ﬂuxgate compass; and body motions using three accelerometers and a pressure transducer. Data are sampled for 128 s every 5 min and reduced into ensemble and band-averaged spectra and statistical parameters. The processed data are transferred to a disk every 6 h along with one 128-s set of unprocessed data. In a 2-day experiment, the instrument experienced peak ﬂows of 0.15 m sϪ1 and resolved dissipation rates in currents as slow as 0.03 m sϪ1. Spectra of velocity ﬂuctuations agree closely with the Nasmyth universal spectrum. For dissipation rates, the lower limit of detection is determined by electronic noise, while the upper limit is set by the angle of attack of cross-stream velocity ﬂuctuations. Both constraints become less restrictive with increasing current. The electronic noise falls below 10Ϫ10 W kgϪ1 in ﬂows faster than 0.1 m sϪ1 for which the authors detected dissipation rates as low as 4 ϫ 10Ϫ10 W kgϪ1. The autonomous instrument makes it possible to obtain long time series at a much reduced cost compared to conventional proﬁling from a ship.},

  shorttitle = {Climate Change},
  abstract = {Climate change could strongly affect the wheat crop that accounts for 21\% of food and 200 million hectares of farmland worldwide. This article reviews some of the approaches for addressing the expected effects that climate change may likely inﬂict on wheat in some of the most important wheat growing areas, namely germplasm adaptation, system management, and mitigation. Future climate scenarios suggest that global warming may be beneﬁcial for the wheat crop in some regions, but could reduce productivity in zones where optimal temperatures already exist. For example, by 2050, as a result of possible climate shifts in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGPs) – currently part of the favorable, high potential, irrigated, low rainfall mega-environment, which accounts for 15\% of global wheat production – as much as 51\% of its area might be reclassiﬁed as a heat-stressed, irrigated, short-season production mega-environment. This shift would also represent a signiﬁcant reduction in wheat yields, unless appropriate cultivars and crop management practices were offered to and adopted by South Asian farmers. Under the same climate scenarios, the area covered by the cool, temperate wheat mega-environment could expand as far as 658N in both North America and Eurasia. To adapt and mitigate the climate change effects on wheat supplies for the poor, germplasm scientists and agronomists are developing heat-tolerant wheat germplasm, as well as cultivars better adapted to conservation agriculture. Encouraging results include identifying sources of alleles for heat tolerance and their introgression into breeding populations through conventional methods and biotechnology. Likewise, agronomists and extension agents are aiming to cut CO2 emissions by reducing tillage and the burning of crop residues. Mitigation research promises to reduce emissions of nitrous oxide by using infrared sensors and the normalized differential vegetative index (NDVI) that determines the right times and correct amounts of fertilizer to apply. Wheat geneticists and physiologists are also assessing wild relatives of wheat as potential sources of genes with inhibitory effects on soil nitriﬁcation. Through the existing global and regional research-for-development networks featuring wheat, technology and knowledge can ﬂow to allow farmers to face the risks associated with climate change.},

  issn = {0022-3670, 1520-0485},
  abstract = {Continuous depth–time measurements of upper-ocean velocity are used to estimate the wavenumber–frequency spectrum of shear. A fundamental characteristic of these spectra is that the frequency bandwidth increases linearly with increasing wavenumber magnitude. This can be interpreted as the signature of Doppler shifting of the observations by time-changing “background” currents as well as by instrument motion. Here, the hypothesis is posed that the apparently continuous wavenumber–frequency spectrum of oceanic shear results from the advective “smearing” of discrete spectral lines. In the Arctic Ocean, lines at the inertial (␻ ϭ Ϫf ) and vortical (␻ ϭ 0) frequencies (where f is the Coriolis frequency) account for most of the variance in the shear spectrum. In the tropical ocean, two classes of inertial waves are considered, accounting for 70\% of the observed shear variance. A simple model is introduced to quantify the effects of lateral advection, random vertical advection (“fine-structure contamination”), and deterministic (tidal) vertical advection on these “otherwise monochromatic” records. Model frequency spectra are developed in terms of the probability density and/or spectrum of the advecting fields for general but idealized situations. The model successfully mimics the increasing frequency bandwidth of the shear spectrum with increasing vertical wavenumber. Excellent fits to the observed frequency spectrum of shear are obtained for the Arctic (weak advection and short-spatial-scale inertial waves) and low-latitude (strong advection and long and short inertial waves) observations. While successfully replicating the wavenumber–frequency spectrum of shear, the model does not even consider motion at scales greater than ϳ250 m, the “energy containing” scales of the internal wave field. To a first approximation, the waves with the majority of the kinetic and potential energy constitute a population apart from those with the momentum, shear, and strain.},

The associated vertical wavenumber frequency spectrum of strain, when viewed in an isopycnal-following frame, displays a clear spectral gap at low vertical wavenumber, separating the quasigeostrophic (vortical) strain ﬁeld and the superinertial internal wave continuum. This gap enables both model and linear-ﬁlter-based methods for separating the submesoscale and internal wave strain ﬁelds. These ﬁelds are examined independently in six ﬁeld programs spanning the period 1983–2002. Vortical and internal wave strain variances are often comparable in the upper thermocline, of order 0.2. However, vortical strain tends to decrease with increasing depth (decreasing buoyancy frequency N2 5 2g/r(dr/dz) as ;(N2)1/2, while internal wave strain variance increases as ;(N2)21/2, exceeding vortical variance by a factor of 5–10 at depths below 500 m.},

  abstract = {A monthlong ﬁeld survey in July 2007, focused on the North Paciﬁc subtropical frontal zone (STFZ) near 308N, 1588W, combined towed depth-cycling conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) proﬁling with shipboard current observations. Measurements were used to investigate the distribution and structure of thermohaline intrusions. The study revealed that local extrema of vertical salinity proﬁles, often used as intrusion indicators, were only a subset of a wider class of distortions in thermohaline ﬁelds due to interleaving processes. A new method to investigate interleaving based on diapycnal spiciness curvature was used to describe an expanded class of laterally coherent intrusions. STFZ intrusions were characterized by their overall statistics and by a number of case studies. Thermohaline interleaving was particularly intense within 5 km of two partially compensated fronts, where intrusions with both positive and negative salinity anomalies were widespread. The vertical and cross-frontal scales of the intrusions were on the order of 10 m and 5 km, respectively. Though highly variable, the slopes of these features were typically intermediate between those of isopycnals and isohalines. Although the inﬂuence of double-diffusive processes sometime during the evolution of intrusions could not be excluded, the broad spectrum of the observed features suggests that any role of double diffusion was secondary.},

  abstract = {When mid-latitude internal waves are at the background state modeled by Garrett and Munk (J. Geophys. Res., 80: 291-297, 1975), wave-wave interactions transfer energy to dissipative scales so slowly that instabilities generate overturns not much larger than the scales at which viscosity dissipates the turbulence. Consequently, high wavenumber spectra contain only the viscous decay portion of the universal turbulent spectrum. Increases in low-wavenumber shear above background produce larger overturns and turbulence sufficiently intense to form well-developed inertial subranges. The turbulent region of the vertical spectrum is separated from the wave region by a k31 rolloff that does not vary with the amplitude of low-wavenumber shear, indicating that the wave field is saturated. At low latitudes, internal wave shear is generally more intense than at mid latitudes, but the turbulence is similar to that found with mid-latitude waves at background. Dynamically, the anomaly implies that wave-wave interactions transfer energy to dissipative scales more slowly at low latitudes than at high latitudes. Kinematically, this anomaly results from steeper slope in the rolloff range.},

  issn = {21699275},
  abstract = {This work studies the subduction of the shelf water along the onshore edge of a warm-core ring that impinges on the edge of the Mid-Atlantic Bight continental shelf. The dynamical analysis is based on observations by satellites and from the Ocean Observatories Initiative Pioneer Array observatory as well as idealized numerical model simulations. They together show that frontogenesis-induced submesoscale frontal subduction with order-one Rossby and Froude numbers occurs on the onshore edge of the ring. The subduction ﬂow results from the onshore migration of the warm-core ring that intensiﬁes the density front on the interface of the ring and shelf waters. The subduction is a part of the cross-front secondary circulation trying to relax the intensifying density front. The dramatically different physical and biogeochemical properties of the ring and shelf waters provide a great opportunity to visualize the subduction phenomenon. Entrained by the ring-edge current, the subducted shelf water is subsequently transported offshore below a surface layer of ring water and alongside of the surface-visible shelf-water streamer. It explains the historical observations of isolated subsurface packets of shelf water along the ring periphery in the slope sea. Model-based estimate suggests that this type of subduction-associated subsurface cross-shelfbreak transport of the shelf water could be substantial relative to other major forms of shelfbreak water exchange. This study also proposes that outward spreading of the ring-edge front by the frontal subduction may facilitate entrainment of the shelf water by the ring-edge current and enhances the shelf-water streamer transport at the shelf edge. Plain Language Summary This study is based on measurements from satellites and the Ocean Observatories Initiative Pioneer Array observatory at the edge of the Mid-Atlantic Bight continental shelf. It shows an unusual form of downward ﬂow (subduction) of the shelf water on the edge of a Gulf Stream warm-core ring that migrates toward the shallow continental shelf. Computer simulations reproduce the observed phenomenon and reveal the underlying mechanism: the onshore migration of the warm-core ring sharpens the interface of the ring and shelf waters; the subduction ﬂow is a part of the cross-sectional circulation trying to relax the sharpening interface. The dramatically different physical and chemical properties of the ring and shelf waters help visualize the phenomenon. The subducted shelf water is then carried into the deep sea underneath a surface layer of warm-core ring water by the strong ring current. This offshore ﬂow of the shelf water represents a type of water exchange process at the shelf edge that can potentially be signiﬁcant but has not been well studied. It does not have a surface signature and cannot be seen by satellites. The subsurface measurements from the Pioneer Array observatory provide a great opportunity for this study.},

Yet in most assessments of his science, far less attention is paid to his ﬂuid dynamics work because it is dwarfed by other, more prominent work.

After a few biographical remarks, I recapitulate and assess the essential parts of this work, putting my remarks in the context of times and people with whom Chandrasekhar interacted.

Between these extremes, patterns emerge, possibly interact, and die sooner or later. This review summarizes recent developments on the problem of mixing in its lamellar representation. This point of view visualizes a mixture as a set of stretched lamellae, or sheets, possibly interacting with each other. It relies on a near-exact formulation of the Fourier equation on a moving substrate and allows one to bridge the spatial structure and evolution of the concentration field with its statistical content in a direct way. Within this frame, one can precisely describe both the dynamics of the concentration levels in a mixture as a function of the intensity of the stirring motions at the scale of a single lamella and the interaction rule between adjacent lamellae, thus offering a detailed representation of the mixture content, its structure, and their evolution in time.},

While back-of-the-envelope estimates have suggested that swimming marine organisms might generate as much high-Reynolds-number turbulence as deep-ocean tide- and wind-generated internal waves, and that turbulent dissipation rates of O(10−5 W kg−1) (Re ∼ 105) could be produced by aggregations of organisms ranging from O(0.01 m) krill to O(10 m) cetaceans, comparable to strong wind and buoyancy forcing near the surface, microstructure measurements do not find consistently elevated dissipation associated with diel vertically migrating krill. Elevated dissipation rates are associated with schools of O(0.1– 1 m) fish but with low mixing coefficients (γ ∼ 0.002–0.02, as compared with γ ∼ 0.2 for geophysical turbulence). Likewise, viscously induced drift at low Reynolds numbers produces little mixing of temperature, solutes, dissolved nutrients, and gases when realistic swimmers and molecular scalar diffusion are taken into account. The conclusion is that, while the marine biosphere can generate turbulence, it contributes little ocean mixing compared with breaking internal gravity waves.},

  abstract = {The abyssal ocean is primarily ﬁlled by cold, dense waters formed around Antarctica and collectively referred to as Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). At steady state, AABW must be consumed in the ocean interior at the same rate it is produced, but how and where this consumption is achieved remains poorly understood. Here, estimates of abyssal water mass transformation by geothermal heating and parameterized internal wave–driven mixing are presented. This study uses maps of the energy input to internal waves by tidal and geostrophic motions interacting with topography combined with assumptions about the distribution of energy dissipation to evaluate dianeutral transports induced by breaking internal tides and lee waves. Geothermal transformation is assessed based on a map of geothermal heat ﬂuxes. Under the hypotheses underlying the constructed climatologies of buoyancy ﬂuxes, the authors calculate that locally dissipating internal tides and geothermal heating contribute, respectively, about 8 and 5 Sverdrups (Sv; 1 Sv [ 106 m3 s21) of AABW consumption (upwelling), mostly north of 308S. In contrast, parameterized lee wave–driven mixing causes signiﬁcant transformation only in the Southern Ocean, where it forms about 3 Sv of AABW, decreasing the mean density but enhancing the northward ﬂow of abyssal waters. The possible role of remotely dissipating internal tides in complementing AABW consumption is explored based on idealized distributions of mixing energy. Depending mostly on the chosen vertical structure, such mixing could drive 1 to 28 Sv of additional AABW upwelling, highlighting the need to better constrain the spatial distribution of remote dissipation. Though they carry large uncertainties, these climatological transformation estimates shed light on the qualitative functioning and key unknowns of the diabatic overturning.},

Strong signals were associated with solar insolation and its modulation by cloud cover, and, in the 5- to 50-day range, with intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs). The northeast (NE) monsoon (DJF) was typically cloud free, with strong latent heat loss and several moderate wind events, and had the only seasonal mean ocean heat loss. The spring intermonsoon (MAM) was cloud free and had light winds and the strongest ocean heating. Strong ISOs and Tropical Cyclone Komen were seen in the southwest (SW) monsoon (JJA), when 65\% of the 2.2-m total rain fell, and oceanic mean heating was small. The fall intermonsoon (SON) initially had moderate convective systems and mean ocean heating, with a transition to drier winds and mean ocean heat loss in the last month. Observed surface freshwater ﬂux applied to a layer of the observed thickness produced drops in salinity with timing and magnitude similar to the initial drops in salinity in the summer monsoon, but did not reproduce the salinity variability of the fall intermonsoon. Observed surface heat ﬂux has the potential to cause the temperature trends of the different seasons, but uncertainty in how shortwave radiation is absorbed in the upper ocean limits quantifying the role of surface forcing in the evolution of mixed layer temperature.},

  abstract = {In response to the Indian Monsoon freshwater forcing, the Bay of Bengal exhibits a very strong seasonal cycle in sea surface salinity (SSS), especially near the mouths of the Ganges-Brahmaputra and along the east coast of India. In this paper, we use an eddy-permitting ( 25 km resolution) regional ocean general circulation model simulation to quantify the processes responsible for this SSS seasonal cycle. Despite the absence of relaxation toward observations, the model reproduces the main features of the observed SSS seasonal cycle, with freshest water in the northeastern Bay, particularly during and after the monsoon. The model also displays an intense and shallow freshening signal in a narrow ( 100 km wide) strip that hugs the east coast of India, from September to January, in good agreement with high-resolution measurements along two ships of opportunity lines. The mixed layer salt budget conﬁrms that the strong freshening in the northern Bay during the monsoon results from the Ganges-Brahmaputra river discharge and from precipitation over the ocean. From September onward, the East India Coastal Current transports this freshwater southward along the east coast of India, reaching the southern tip of India in November. The surface freshening results in an enhanced vertical salinity gradient that increases salinity of the surface layer by vertical processes. Our results reveal that the erosion of the freshwater tongue along the east coast of India is not driven by northward horizontal advection, but by vertical processes that eventually overcome the freshening by southward advection and restore SSS to its premonsoon values. The salinity-stratiﬁed barrier layer hence only acts as a ‘‘barrier’’ for vertical heat ﬂuxes, but is associated with intense vertical salt ﬂuxes in the Bay of Bengal.},

  abstract = {The pathways of cross-equatorial ﬂows originating in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal are modelled using a 4.5-layer model of the Indian Ocean. Passive tracers and drifters are used to diagnose the transports. The model results show that relatively fresh Bay of Bengal water is transported southward across the equator throughout the year east of 90 E, but during the southwest monsoon as far west as 60 E. In the western part of the ocean, northward transport of low-salinity water across the equator takes place in a narrow region of positive relative vorticity ﬂows in the Somali Current. Substantial southward cross-equatorial exchange of Arabian Sea water occurs as far east as 95 E, primarily from May to September. During the northeast monsoon the net transport is small, but large variability in the exchange of Arabian Sea water is associated with planetary equatorial waves. The cross-equatorial circulation emerge as a clockwise gyre, with southward ﬂow in the mixed layer of the interior of the ocean, and a northward ﬂow in the western boundary current region, including the mixed layer as well as subsurface layers. The path of the low-salinity or freshwater transport is associated with this circulation.},

  abstract = {The role of surface forcing in the semiannual evolution of the upper-ocean temperature, salinity, and velocity ﬁelds in the Arabian Sea is examined. To do so, variability in the upper ocean in the central Arabian Sea was observed from an array of moorings deployed from October 1994 to October 1995. The Northeast (NE) Monsoon was characterized by moderate winds, clear skies, and dry air; sea-surface temperature (SST) dropped by 31C; the ocean lost an average of 19.7 W mÀ2 and the mixed layer deepened by 100 m in response. The Southwest (SW) Monsoon was accompanied by strong winds, cloudy skies, and moist air; the ocean gained an average of 89.5 W mÀ2 but SST dropped by 5.51C and the mixed layer deepened to almost 80 m. The response to the NE Monsoon included daily cycling in the depth of the mixed layer in response to the diurnal cycle in the buoyancy forcing and a weak local, wind-driven response. Stronger windforcing during the SW Monsoon dramatically reduced diurnal restratiﬁcation, and a clearer signal of local, wind-driven ﬂow in the upper ocean was found. The strongest velocity signal in the upper ocean, however, was the ﬂow associated with mesoscale geostrophic features that passed slowly through the moored array, dominating the current meter records in the ﬁrst part of the NE Monsoon and again in the latter part of the SW Monsoon. One-dimensional heat and freshwater balances, which held at other times through the year, broke down during the passage of these features. r 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  issn = {0022-3670, 1520-0485},
  abstract = {In this study, the salinity budget of the North Atlantic subtropical salinity maximum region for control volumes bounded by isohaline surfaces is analyzed. The authors provide closed budgets based on output from a high-resolution numerical simulation and partial budgets based on analyses of observational climatologies of hydrography and surface ﬂuxes. With this choice of control volume, advection is eliminated from the instantaneous volume-integrated salt budget, and time-mean advection is eliminated from the budget evaluated from time-averaged data. In this way, the role of irreversible mixing processes in the maintenance and variability of the salinity maximum are more readily revealed. By carrying out the analysis with both nearinstantaneous and time-averaged model output, the role of mesoscale eddies in stirring and mixing for this water mass is determined. This study ﬁnds that the small-scale mixing acting on enhanced gradients generated by the mesoscale eddies is approximately equal to that acting on the large-scale gradients estimated from climatological-mean conditions. The isohaline salinity budget can be related to water mass transformation rates associated with surface forcing and mixing processes in a straightforward manner. The authors ﬁnd that the surface net evaporation in the North Atlantic salinity maximum region accounts for a transformation of 7 Sverdrups (Sv; 1 Sv [ 106 m3 s21) of water across the 37-psu isohaline outcrop into the salinity maximum in the simulation, whereas the estimate based on climatological observations is 9 to 10 Sv.},

  abstract = {With a focus on the Bay of Bengal, models ranging from a 1/12.5° global ocean model to a ¼° regional Indian Ocean model to a 2 km local high-resolution coupled model are used to simulate salinity exchanges in the Indian Ocean. Global Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model simulations show a surprisingly large persistent flow of high-salinity water from the equatorial Indian Ocean into the Bay of Bengal during the northeast monsoon, although it is weaker than during the southwest monsoon. On average, salt is transported into the Bay of Bengal between 83°E and 95°E, and low-salinity water flows southward near the east coast of Sri Lanka and east of 95°E. The Regional Ocean Modeling System shows that knowledge of river input of freshwater is essential for modeling surface salinities correctly in the Bay of Bengal. High-resolution coupled model simulations are in agreement with recent observations and show that a strong subsurface current with a speed of about 1 m s–1 intrudes into the Bay of Bengal beneath southward-flowing low-salinity water during the northeast monsoon. The subsurface high-salinity water, which originates in the northern Arabian Sea, spreads northward into the Bay of Bengal and downward along constant density surfaces. North of 10°N, the model simulation implies that mixing takes place on density surfaces at depths of 100–150 m after advection of cold, low-salinity water from the north, and subsequent stirring of the two water masses. Vertical diffusion plays an insignificant role in this mixing.},

  abstract = {The Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) is a coherent circulation feature that rings the Antarctic continental shelf and regulates the ﬂow of water toward the Antarctic coastline. The structure and variability of the ASC inﬂuences key processes near the Antarctic coastline that have global implications, such as the melting of Antarctic ice shelves and water mass formation that determines the strength of the global overturning circulation. Recent theoretical, modeling, and observational advances have revealed new dynamical properties of the ASC, making it timely to review. Earlier reviews of the ASC focused largely on local classiﬁcations of water properties of the ASC’s primary front. Here we instead provide a classiﬁcation of the current’s frontal structure based on the dynamical mechanisms that govern both the along-slope and cross-slope circulation; these two modes of circulation are strongly coupled, similar to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Highly variable motions, such as dense overﬂows, tides, and eddies are shown to be critical components of cross-slope and cross-shelf exchange, but understanding of how the distribution and intensity of these processes will evolve in a changing climate remains poor due to observational and modeling limitations. Results linking the ASC to larger modes of climate variability, such as El Niño, show that the ASC is an integral part of global climate. An improved dynamical understanding of the ASC is still needed to accurately model and predict future Antarctic sea ice extent, the stability of the Antarctic ice sheets, and the Southern Ocean’s contribution to the global carbon cycle.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale turbulence in the ocean strongly affects the circulation, water mass formation, and transport of tracers. Little is known, however, about how mixing varies on climate timescales. We present the first time-resolved global dataset of lateral mesoscale eddy diffusivities at the ocean surface, obtained by applying the suppressed mixing length theory to satellite-observed velocities. We find interannual variability throughout the global ocean, regionally correlated with climate indices such as ENSO, NAO, DMI, and PDO. Changes in mixing length, driven by variations in the large-scale flow, often exceed the effect of variations in local eddy kinetic energy, previously thought of as the primary driver of variability in eddy mixing. This mechanism, not currently represented in global climate models, could have far-reaching consequences for the distribution of heat, salt, and carbon in the global ocean, as well as ecosystem dynamics and regional dynamics such as ENSO variance.
Satellite observations show ocean mixing connected to global climate variability due to changes in large scale circulation.

Early validation results are as follows: the TMPA provides reasonable performance at monthly scales, although it is shown to have precipitation rate–dependent low bias due to lack of sensitivity to low precipitation rates over ocean in one of the input products [based on Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B)]. At finer scales the TMPA is successful at approximately reproducing the surface observation–based histogram of precipitation, as well as reasonably detecting large daily events. The TMPA, however, has lower skill in correctly specifying moderate and light event amounts on short time intervals, in common with other finescale estimators.

  abstract = {Surface current observations from Indian Coastal Ocean Radar Network installed along the Tamil Nadu coast (southeast India) was used to quantify the mesoscale eddies associated with East India Coastal Current (EICC) during 2014–2017. A ﬂow geometry-based eddy detection algorithm has been applied to the daily averaged surface current maps and was able to detect and track mesoscale eddies of variable temporal and spatial scales. A total of 51 (27 cyclonic and 24 anticyclonic) eddy events, which lasted for more than 4 days, were identiﬁed during this period. Total count of cyclonic eddies exceeded the anticyclonic eddies with a clear seasonal pattern concurrent with the mean ﬂow of EICC. The number of anticyclonic eddies leads in southwest monsoon and spring transition period; however, in fall transition and northeast monsoon period number of cyclonic eddies dominates in line with the poleward and equatorward phase of EICC, respectively. Monthly eddy kinetic energy maps showed a seasonal cycle with highest values in November and April. Monthly maps of the surface current vectors provide the broader picture of the seasonal reversal of currents in February and October and low magnitude oﬀshore ﬂow in the summer monsoon period. The Rossby number distribution along a transect perpendicular to the coast was in the order of O(1) shows the presence of strong submesoscale dynamics in the study domain.

  abstract = {A year-long mooring data are used to study the upper ocean unstable events and instabilities at 18∘N 89∘E, which is a climatologically important region in the North Bay of Bengal. Near-surface stability is studied from the context of the buoyancy frequency normalized shear (Vz∕N) and reduced shear (S2 − 4N2) which are convenient measures to quantify ﬂow stability, compared to the more widely used Richardson number (Ri). The analysis is carried out across three contrasting time periods, the monsoon, postmonsoon, and the winter of year 2012. Although it is well known that the ﬂow stability changes from stable to unstable at Ri = Ricr = 0.25, the relative importance of the perturbations of shear and buoyancy frequency in driving the unstable events is not well studied over the open oceans and more particularly over the Bay of Bengal. At 18∘N, 89∘E both higher than average shear and lower than average buoyancy frequency perturbations are crucial in driving the unstable events during the summer and premonsoon period. However, at increasing depths, the inﬂuence of shear perturbations becomes more dominant. Invoking the Miles-Howard criteria for ﬂow instability, it is seen that during the postmonsoon period, the buoyancy frequency perturbations are more critical than shear perturbations in driving the unstable events. In winter, the unstable events are inﬂuenced by both the buoyancy frequency and shear perturbations.},

Methods of defining Southern Ocean spatial structures traditionally rely on somewhat ad hoc combinations of physical, chemical, and dynamic properties. As a step toward an alternative approach for describing spatial variability in temperature, here we apply an unsupervised classification technique (i.e., Gaussian mixture modeling or GMM) to Southern Ocean Argo float temperature profiles. GMM, without using any latitude or longitude information, automatically identifies several spatially coherent circumpolar classes influenced by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. In addition, GMM identifies classes that bear the imprint of mode/intermediate water formation and export, large-scale gyre circulation, and the Agulhas Current, among others. Because GMM is robust, standardized, and automated, it can potentially be used to identify structures (such as fronts) in both observational and model data sets, possibly making it a useful complement to existing classification techniques.},

Additionally, the heat ﬂux divergence is of the incorrect sign in the upper 80 m. An alternative class of parameterizations is examined that expresses the mixing coefﬁcients in terms of the large-scale kinetic energy, shear, and Richardson number. These representations collapse the turbulence diffusivities above and below the Equatorial Undercurrent, and a tuned version is able to reproduce the vertical turbulence heat ﬂux within the 50–180-m depth range. Kinetic energy is not Galilean invariant, so the collapse of the data with the new parameterization suggests that oceanic turbulence responds to boundary forcing at depths well below the surface mixed layer.},

This framework is applied to a global ocean sea ice model at two horizontal resolutions (1/48 and 1/108) to evaluate the partioning of the diathermal heat transport between different mixing processes and their spatial and seasonal structure. The diathermal heat transport peaks around 228C at 1.6 PW, similar to the peak meridional heat transport. Diffusive mixing transfers this heat from waters above 228C, where surface forcing warms the tropical ocean, to temperatures below 228C where midlatitude waters are cooled. In the control 1/48 simulation, half of the parameterized vertical mixing is achieved by background diffusion, to which sensitivity is explored. The remainder is associated with parameterizations for surface boundary layer, shear instability, and tidal mixing. Nearly half of the seasonal cycle in the peak vertical mixing heat ﬂux is associated with shear instability in the tropical Paciﬁc cold tongue, highlighting this region’s global importance. The framework presented also allows for quantiﬁcation of numerical mixing associated with the model’s advection scheme. Numerical mixing has a substantial seasonal cycle and increases to compensate for reduced explicit vertical mixing. Finally, applied to Argo observations the diathermal framework reveals a heat content seasonal cycle consistent with the simulations. These results highlight the utility of the diathermal framework for understanding the role of diabatic processes in ocean circulation and climate.},

  abstract = {The response of quasigeostrophic (QG) oceanic vortices to tropical cyclone (TC) forcing is investigated using an isopycnic ocean model. Idealized oceanic currents and wind ﬁelds derived from observational data acquired during Hurricane Katrina are used to initialize this model. It is found that the upwelling response is a function of the curl of wind-driven acceleration of oceanic mixed layer (OML) currents rather than a function of the wind stress curl. Upwelling (downwelling) regimes prevail under the TC’s eye as it translates over cyclonic (anticyclonic) QG vortices. OML cooling of ;18C occurs over anticyclones because of the combined effects of downwelling, instantaneous turbulent entrainment over the deep warm water column (weak stratiﬁcation), and vertical dispersion of near-inertial energy. By contrast, OML cooling of ;48C occurs over cyclones due to the combined effects of upwelling, instantaneous turbulent entrainment over regions of tight vertical thermal gradients (strong stratiﬁcation), and trapping of near-inertial energy that enhances vertical shear and mixing at the OML base. The rotational rate of the QG vortex affects the dispersion of near-inertial waves. As rotation is increased in both cyclones and anticyclones, the near-inertial response is shifted toward more energetic frequencies that enhance vertical shear and mixing. TCinduced temperature anomalies in QG vortices propagate westward with time, deforming the cold wake. Therefore, to accurately simulate the impact of TC-induced OML cooling and feedback mechanisms on storm intensity, coupled ocean–atmosphere TC models must resolve geostrophic ocean eddy location as well as thermal, density, and velocity structures.},

In the absence of tides, it is found that the basin-scale energetics are governed by inertial oscillations and low-mode near-inertial wave motions that are generated near the lateral slopes of the basin. These motions are shown to be associated with persistent narrow shear-bands, strongly correlated with bands of enhanced dissipation rates that are the major source of mixing inside the permanent halocline of the basin. In spite of different stratification, near-inertial wave structure, and atmospheric forcing during summer and winter conditions, respectively, the observed dissipation rates were found to scale with local shear and stratification in a nearly identical way. This scaling was different from the Gregg-Henyey-type models used for the open ocean, but largely consistent with the MacKinnon-Gregg scaling developed for the continental shelf.},

  volume = {46},
  issn = {0022-3670, 1520-0485},
  abstract = {During each summer monsoon, the Bay of Bengal is inundated by a large amount of rain and river discharge. The effects of this freshening are gradually reversed over the course of the year, with near-surface salinities typically returning to their presummer monsoon levels before the start of the next rainy season. While the forcing responsible for the summertime freshening is clear, the processes that act to restore the bay’s salinity are not well understood. To examine these processes, the authors construct a basin-integrated, near-surface, seasonal salinity budget using data-assimilated output from the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). From this salinity budget, it is deduced that vertical salt ﬂuxes are primarily responsible for counterbalancing the near-surface freshening caused by the summertime freshwater ﬂuxes. These vertical salt ﬂuxes are largest during the months that immediately follow the summer monsoon, when the near-surface halocline is strongest. These results must be tempered with the knowledge that HYCOM misrepresents some key features of the bay’s salinity ﬁeld. In particular, the model tends to overestimate salinity along the East Indian Coastal Current during its equatorward phase. Notwithstanding these biases, these results still suggest that vertical processes have a prominent role in the bay’s near-surface salinity budget.},

It is based on an original compilation of all available in situ SSS observations in that region, assembled in a 2°-resolution trimonthly gridded field. We find that year-to-year SSS variability is particularly strong in the North-Eastern part of the Bay. Over recent years, this variability takes the form of two successive and opposite phases: a saltening phase from mid-2009 to late 2010, immediately followed by a freshening phase from late 2010 to late 2011. The typical magnitude of each anomalous spell is about one in the practical salinity scale, making this area one of the most variable of the tropical oceans at interannual timescales. A simple mixed-layer salt budget indicates that year-to-year large-scale SSS variability in the Northern Bay of Bengal is primarily driven by freshwater fluxes variability with a correlation of 0.68, with rather independent contributions from precipitation and river runoff. The oceanic surface circulation variability contributes less systematically to the large-scale SSS evolution in the Northern Bay of Bengal over the entire record with a correlation of 0.13, despite a strong contribution at times, in particular during the 2011 positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) freshening.},

Together, they reveal an undercurrent below 100–200 m ﬂowing in the opposite direction to the surface current, which is most pronounced during boreal spring and summer and switches direction between these two seasons. The volume transport of the undercurrent (200–1000 m layer) can be more than 10 Sv in either direction, exceeding the transport of 1–6 Sv carried by the surface current (0–200 m layer). The undercurrent transports relatively fresher water southward during spring, while it advects more saline water northward along the east coast of Sri Lanka during summer. Although the undercurrent is potentially a pathway of salt exchange between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, the observations and the ocean general circulation models suggest that the salinity contrast between seasons and between the boundary current and interior is less than 0.09 in the subsurface layer, suggesting a small salt transport by the undercurrent of less than 4 \% of the salinity deﬁcit in the Bay of Bengal.},

  issn = {14635003},
  abstract = {Salinity in the Bay of Bengal is highly heterogeneous, with extremely fresh waters found at the surface in the Northern part of the basin, and saltier waters at subsurface as well as to the south. This paper investigates the seasonal structure of sea surface salinity of the Bay in a regional high-resolution model forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis and various precipitation products. Surface circulation is believed to drive the spreading of northern Bay of Bengal fresh waters to the rest of the Indian Ocean. We ﬁrst present a series of experiments to infer the sensitivity of modeled circulation to various numerical choices. Surface circulation is found to be sensitive to the horizontal resolution of the model, with the 1/12° version appearing much more realistic than the 1/4° version. The sidewall boundary condition is also drastically inﬂuencing the characteristics of the western boundary current simulated. We then investigate the sensitivity of the salinity response to the various precipitation products. We observe that ERA-Interim excess precipitation induces a fresh bias in the surface salinity response. Spaceborne precipitation products are more satisfactory. We then identify the pathways of the northern Bay freshwater mass, based on passive tracers experiments. Our model suggests that over timescales of a few months, vertical exchanges between the upper fresh layer and the underlying saltier layer appear to be the main export pathway for the freshwater. The horizontal circulation within the mixed layer also acts to convey fresh waters out of the Bay at these timescales, but in a lesser quantity compared to the vertical export. Beyond its intrinsic interest for the understanding of Bay of Bengal physics, this study highlights the need for a careful design of any realistic numerical model, in three key aspects: the choice of the resolution of the model, the choice of the sub-grid scale parameterizations, and the choice of the forcing ﬂuxes.},

  abstract = {Hydrographic observations were taken along two coastal sections and one open ocean section in the Bay of Bengal during the 1999 southwest monsoon, as a part of the Bay of Bengal Monsoon Experiment (BOBMEX). The coastal section in the northwestern Bay of Bengal, which was occupied twice, captured a freshwater plume in its two stages: ﬁrst when the plume was restricted to the coastal region although separated from the coast, and then when the plume spread offshore. Below the freshwater layer there were indications of an undercurrent. The coastal section in the southern Bay of Bengal was marked by intense coastal upwelling in a 50 km wide band. In regions under the inﬂuence of the freshwater plume, the mixed layer was considerably thinner and occasionally led to the formation of a temperature inversion. The mixed layer and isothermal layer were of similar depth for most of the proﬁles within and outside the freshwater plume and temperature below the mixed layer decreased rapidly till the top of seasonal thermocline. There was no barrier layer even in regions well under the inﬂuence of the freshwater plume. The freshwater plume in the open Bay of Bengal does not advect to the south of 16 N during the southwest monsoon. A model of the Indian Ocean, forced by heat, momentum and freshwater ﬂuxes for the year 1999, reproduces the freshwater plume in the Bay of Bengal reasonably well. Model currents as well as the surface circulation calculated as the sum of geostrophic and Ekman drift show a southeastward North Bay Monsoon Current (NBMC) across the Bay, which forms the southern arm of a cyclonic gyre. The NBMC separates the very low salinity waters of the northern Bay from the higher salinities in the south and thus plays an important role in the regulation of near surface stratiﬁcation.},

This is a particularly challenging region for the application of satellite-derived SSS measurements because of the potential pollution of the SSS signal by radio frequency interference (RFI) and land-induced contamination in this semi-enclosed basin. The present study validates recent level-3 monthly gridded (1° × 1°) SSS products from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Aquarius missions to an exhaustive in situ SSS product for the BoB. Current SMOS SSS retrievals do not perform better than existing climatologies. This is in stark contrast to Aquarius, which outperforms SMOS and available SSS climatologies everywhere in the BoB. While SMOS only captures the SSS seasonal evolution in the northern part of the Bay, Aquarius accurately captures the seasonal signal in the entire basin. The Aquarius product is also able to capture SSS non-seasonal anomalies, with an approximate correlation (r) of 0.75 with box-averaged in situ data in the northern, central, and western parts of the Bay. Aquarius can, thus, be conﬁdently used to monitor large-scale year-to-year SSS variations in the BoB.},

OSTIA uses satellite SST data provided by international agencies via the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Regional/Global Task Sharing (R/GTS) framework. GHRSST products include data from microwave and infrared satellite instruments with accompanying uncertainty estimates. The system also uses in situ SST data available over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) and a sea-ice concentration product from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Applications Facility (OSI-SAF). The SST analysis is a multi-scale optimal interpolation that is designed for applications in numerical weather prediction and ocean forecasting systems. The background error covariance matrix is speciﬁed using ocean model data and the analysis uses correlation length scales of 10 km and 100 km. The OSTIA system produces a foundation SST estimate (SSTfnd, which is the SST free of diurnal variability) at an output grid resolution of 1/20° (\textasciitilde{} 6 km) although the smallest analysis feature resolution is based on the correlation length scale of 10 km. All satellite SST data are adjusted for bias errors based on a combination of ENVISAT Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) SST data and in situ SST measurements from drifting buoys. Data are ﬁltered (based on surface wind speed data) to remove diurnal variability and AATSR data are adjusted to represent the SST at the same depth as drifting buoy measurements (0.2–1 m) before bias adjustments are made. Global coverage outputs are provided each day in GHRSST L4 netCDF format. A variety of secondary products are also provided including weekly and monthly mean data sets. OSTIA products are continuously monitored and validation/veriﬁcation activities demonstrate that SST products have zero mean bias and an accuracy of \textasciitilde{} 0.57 K compared to in situ measurements. OSTIA is now used operationally as a boundary condition for all weather forecast models at the Met Ofﬁce and at European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). OSTIA is produced by the Met Ofﬁce as part of the European Union Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) MyOcean project.},

  abstract = {The upwelling of deep waters in the Southern Ocean is a critical component of the climate system. The time and zonal mean dynamics of this circulation describe the upwelling of Circumpolar Deep Water and the downwelling of Antarctic Intermediate Water. The thermodynamic drivers of the circulation and their seasonal cycle play a potentially key regulatory role. Here an observationally constrained ocean model and an observation-based seasonal climatology are analyzed from a thermodynamic perspective, to assess the diabatic processes controlling overturning in the Southern Ocean. This reveals a seasonal two-stage cold transit in the formation of intermediate water from upwelled deep water. First, relatively warm and saline deep water is transformed into colder and fresher near-surface winter water via wintertime mixing. Second, winter water warms to form intermediate water through summertime surface heat ﬂuxes. The mixing-driven pathway from deep water to winter water follows mixing lines in thermohaline coordinates indicative of nonlinear processes.},

  abstract = {Two hydrographic surveys in the Gulf of Alaska and the North Paciﬁc subtropical gyre are presented. Both surveys are roughly perpendicular to lateral temperature gradients, and were collected in the summer when there was a shallow mixed layer and a seasonal thermocline. Isopycnal displacements and horizontal velocities are dominated by internal waves. Spice anomalies along isopycnals are examined to diagnose lateral stirring mechanisms. The spectra of spice anomaly gradients along near-surface isopycnals roughly follow power laws of \$kx0:660:2 (variance spectra power laws of \$kx21:460:2), and in most cases, the spectra become redder at depth. The near-surface spectra are possibly consistent with the predictions of quasi-geostrophic turbulence theory (when surface buoyancy effects are accounted for), but the spectra at depth are inconsistent with any quasi-geostrophic theory. Probability distributions of spice gradients exhibit a large peak at low gradients and long tails for large gradients, symptomatic of fronts. Vertical coherence of the spice signal falls off with a decorrelation depth scale that has a maximum of about 80 m at 100 km wavelengths and depends on horizontal wavelength with a power law of approximately kx21=2. Lateral decorrelation length scales are 20–40 km, close to the baroclinic Rossby radius. Lateral stirring occurs over large scales, with average lateral displacements of about 200 km in the upper 75 m, decreasing to 100 km at greater depths. The depth variation of the statistics indicates that time history of tracer stirring on each isopycnal is important, or that there are unconsidered depth-dependent stirring mechanisms.},

  issn = {0022-3670, 1520-0485},
  abstract = {Three mechanisms for self-induced Ekman pumping in the interiors of mesoscale ocean eddies are investigated. The ﬁrst arises from the surface stress that occurs because of differences between surface wind and ocean velocities, resulting in Ekman upwelling and downwelling in the cores of anticyclones and cyclones, respectively. The second mechanism arises from the interaction of the surface stress with the surface current vorticity gradient, resulting in dipoles of Ekman upwelling and downwelling. The third mechanism arises from eddy-induced spatial variability of sea surface temperature (SST), which generates a curl of the stress and therefore Ekman pumping in regions of crosswind SST gradients. The spatial structures and relative magnitudes of the three contributions to eddy-induced Ekman pumping are investigated by collocating satellitebased measurements of SST, geostrophic velocity, and surface winds to the interiors of eddies identiﬁed from their sea surface height signatures. On average, eddy-induced Ekman pumping velocities approach O(10) cm day21. SST-induced Ekman pumping is usually secondary to the two current-induced mechanisms for Ekman pumping. Notable exceptions are the midlatitude extensions of western boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, where SST gradients are strong and all three mechanisms for eddy-induced Ekman pumping are comparable in magnitude. Because the polarity of current-induced curl of the surface stress opposes that of the eddy, the associated Ekman pumping attenuates the eddies. The decay time scale of this attenuation is proportional to the vertical scale of the eddy and inversely proportional to the wind speed. For typical values of these parameters, the decay time scale is about 1.3 yr.},

  abstract = {Measurements by the Multi-Scale Proﬁler (MSP) at seven stations spanning the Straits of Florida characterize levels and patterns of internal wave activity and mixing in this vertically sheared environment. Contrasting properties suggest ﬁve mixing regimes. The largest and most vast is the interior regime, where the background ﬂow has an inverse Richardson number (RiϪ1) ranging up to 0.55, shear is dominated by ﬂuctuations that are 1–4 times stronger than in the open ocean, and turbulent diffusivities are similarly moderate at (1–4) ϫ 10Ϫ5 m2 sϪ1. The high-velocity core of the current, near the surface at midchannel, is associated with weak mixing. To its west is a zone of high mean shear, where strong stratiﬁcation results in background Ri Ϫ1 of only 0.4, ﬂuctuations are weak, and diffusivity is moderate. Intermittent shear features beneath the core have mean Ri Ϫ1 Ͼ 1 and strong turbulence. Two regimes are related to channel topography. Adjacent to the steep eastern slope, ﬁnescale shear is predominately cross-channel, and turbulence varies from nearly the weakest to nearly the strongest. Within 100 m of the channel ﬂoor, turbulent stratiﬁed boundary layers are mixing at (2–6) ϫ 10Ϫ4 m2 sϪ1 to account for one-half of the section-averaged diffusivity. Using existing ﬁnescale parameterizations, observed dissipation rates can be predicted within a factor of 2 for most of this dataset, despite signiﬁcantly strong mean shear and generally anisotropic and asymmetric ﬂuctuations. The exceptions are in the high mean shear zones, where total rather than ﬂuctuating shear yields reasonable estimates, and in some of the more turbulent regions, where shear underestimates mixing. Given its overall moderate levels of turbulence and ﬁnescale shear, the Florida Current is not a hot spot for oceanic mixing.},

  abstract = {The characteristics of westward copropagating features in satellite altimetry, sea surface temperature and ocean colour data are investigated throughout the global oceans between 50° north and 50° south for the period 1998–2008. A new ‘hybrid’ ﬁltering approach allowing features with periods between 37 and 410 days to pass polewards of 20° north and south and features with periods between 37 and 205 days to pass within 20° of the equator is found to isolate features whose speed is consistent with predictions of long planetary wave theory throughout much of the oceans. Features with wavelengths between 300 and 800 km and periods between 205 and 410 days are shown to be a signiﬁcant source of temperature and chlorophyll variability between 20° and 50° north and south, whilst within 20° of the equator, signals in the 800–1500 km and 37–205 days range are predominant. Between 15° and 50° north and south, observed propagation speeds are found to closely match those predicted for ﬁrst-mode baroclinic Rossby waves by theory. In the equatorial Paciﬁc and Atlantic Oceans, features with wavelengths (800–2000 km), periods (15–40 days) and phase speeds (20–50 cm s−1) characteristic of tropical instability waves are preferentially observed. The amplitude and phase relationship between copropagating signals in ocean colour and altimetry and sea surface temperature and altimetry is interpreted in terms of the horizontal (meridional) advection of mean temperature and chlorophyll gradients by Rossby waves, similar to what has recently been observed for non-linear eddies at shorter length scales. The observed phase relationships are in good agreement with the range of phases expected for horizontal advection throughout much of the oceans and consistent with the sign of the mean meridional gradients of temperature and chlorophyll. These results support the view that horizontal advection (be it from waves and/or eddies) is the dominant mode of covariation of temperature and chlorophyll with sea surface height throughout most of the oceans, although the agreement between predicted and observed amplitude and phase relationships is insufﬁcient to completely rule out vertical mechanisms in a few regions. We believe that a ‘one size ﬁts all’ approach for global Rossby wave studies can no longer be considered valid, and although we have modiﬁed our technique to take this into account, we advocate future work to develop a fully latitudinally dependent ﬁltering methodology.},

  abstract = {Numerical experiments are described that pertain to the climate of a coupled atmosphere–ocean–ice system in the absence of land, driven by modern-day orbital and CO2 forcing. Millennial time-scale simulations yield a mean state in which ice caps reach down to 55° of latitude and both the atmosphere and ocean comprise eastward- and westward-flowing zonal jets, whose structure is set by their respective baroclinic instabilities. Despite the zonality of the ocean, it is remarkably efficient at transporting heat meridionally through the agency of Ekman transport and eddy-driven subduction. Indeed the partition of heat transport between the atmosphere and ocean is much the same as the present climate, with the ocean dominating in the Tropics and the atmosphere in the mid–high latitudes. Variability of the system is dominated by the coupling of annular modes in the atmosphere and ocean. Stochastic variability inherent to the atmospheric jets drives variability in the ocean. Zonal flows in the ocean exhibit decadal variability, which, remarkably, feeds back to the atmosphere, coloring the spectrum of annular variability. A simple stochastic model can capture the essence of the process. Finally, it is briefly reviewed how the aquaplanet can provide information about the processes that set the partition of heat transport and the climate of Earth.},

  abstract = {The summertime California Current System (CCS) is characterized by energetic mesoscale eddies, whose sea surface temperature (SST) and surface current can signiﬁcantly modify the wind stress and Ekman pumping. Relative importance of the eddy–wind interactions via SST and surface current in the CCS is examined using a high-resolution (7 km) regional coupled model with a novel coupling approach to isolate the small-scale air–sea coupling by SST and surface current. Results show that when the eddy-induced surface current is allowed to modify the wind stress, the spatially averaged surface eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is reduced by 42\%, and this is primarily due to enhanced surface eddy drag and reduced wind energy transfer. In contrast, the eddy-induced SST–wind coupling has no signiﬁcant impact on the EKE. Furthermore, eddyinduced SST and surface current modify the Ekman pumping via their crosswind SST gradient and surface vorticity gradient, respectively. The resultant magnitudes of the Ekman pumping velocity are comparable, but the implied feedback effects on the eddy statistics are different. The surface current-induced Ekman pumping mainly attenuates the amplitude of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, acting to reduce the eddy activity, while the SST-induced Ekman pumping primarily affects the propagation. Time mean–rectiﬁed change in SST is determined by the altered offshore temperature advection by the mean and eddy currents, but the magnitude of the mean SST change is greater with the eddy-induced current effect. The demonstrated remarkably strong dynamical response in the CCS system to the eddy-induced current–wind coupling indicates that eddyinduced current should play an important role in the regional coupled ocean–atmosphere system.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous full-depth microstructure measurements of turbulence and ﬁnestructure measurements of velocity and density are analyzed to investigate the relationship between turbulence and the internal wave ﬁeld in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. These data reveal a systematic near-bottom overprediction of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate by ﬁnescale parameterization methods in select locations. Sites of near-bottom overprediction are typically characterized by large near-bottom ﬂow speeds and elevated topographic roughness. Further, lower-than-average shear-to-strain ratios indicative of a less near-inertial wave ﬁeld, rotary spectra suggesting a predominance of upward internal wave energy propagation, and enhanced narrowband variance at vertical wavelengths on the order of 100 m are found at these locations. Finally, ﬁnescale overprediction is typically associated with elevated Froude numbers based on the near-bottom shear of the background ﬂow, and a background ﬂow with a systematic backing tendency. Agreement of microstructure- and ﬁnestructure-based estimates within the expected uncertainty of the parameterization away from these special sites, the reproducibility of the overprediction signal across various parameterization implementations, and an absence of indications of atypical instrument noise at sites of parameterization overprediction, all suggest that physics not encapsulated by the parameterization play a role in the fate of bottom-generated waves at these locations. Several plausible underpinning mechanisms based on the limited available evidence are discussed that offer guidance for future studies.},

  abstract = {Observations are presented of microstructure and velocity measurements made on the outer New England shelf in the late summer of 1996 as part of the Coastal Mixing and Optics Experiment. The depth- and timeaveraged turbulent dissipation rate was 5–50 (ϫ 10Ϫ9 W kgϪ1). The associated average diapycnal diffusivity in stratiﬁed water was 5–20 (ϫ 10Ϫ6 m2 sϪ1), comparable to observed open-ocean thermocline values and too low to explain the strong variability observed in local water properties. Dissipation rates and diffusivity were both highly episodic. Turbulent boundary layers grew down from the surface and up from the bottom. The dissipation rate within the bottom boundary layer had an average of 1.2 ϫ 10Ϫ7 W kgϪ1 and varied in magnitude with the strength of near-bottom ﬂow from the barotropic tide, an along-shelf ﬂow, and low-frequency internal waves. The average dissipation rate in the peak thermocline was 5 ϫ 10Ϫ8 W kgϪ1; one-half of the thermocline dissipation was due to the strong shear and strain within six solibores that cumulatively lasted less than a day but contained 100-fold elevated dissipation and diffusivity. Nonsolibore, midcolumn dissipation was strongly correlated with shear from low-frequency internal waves. Dissipation was not well parameterized by Gregg–Henyey-type scaling. An alternate scaling, modiﬁed to account for observed coastal internal wave properties, was in good agreement with measured dissipation rates. At the end of the observational period Hurricane Edouard passed by, producing strong dissipation rates (4 ϫ 10Ϫ6 W kgϪ1) and consequent mixing during and for several days following the peak winds.},

It is also robust because the range of wavenumbers used in the ﬁt is held ﬁxed, and the built-in noise model forces the routine to ignore the spectrum as it gets down toward the noise level. 3) The method provides a theoretical estimate for error bars on the ﬁtted Batchelor wavenumber, based on how broad or narrow the likelihood function is in the vicinity of its peak. 4) Statistical quantities that indicate how well the observed spectrum ﬁts the theoretical form are calculated.

  abstract = {The wavenumber spectra for velocity and temperature in the Gulf Stream region are calculated from a decade (1994–2004) of shipboard acoustic Doppler current proﬁler (ADCP) measurements taken as part of the Oleander Project. The velocity and temperature spectra have comparable magnitude, in terms of the kinetic and potential energy, and both indicate a k23 slope in the mesoscales. In contrast, the corresponding velocity spectrum determined from satellite altimetry sea surface heights yields a signiﬁcantly higher energy level and a k22 slope. The discrepancy between altimeter-derived and directly measured velocity spectra suggests that altimetric velocity probably is contaminated by noise in sea surface height measurement. Also, the k23 slope, which appears to be in agreement with two-dimensional quasigeostrophic turbulence theory, does not support the contemporary surface quasigeostrophic theory. These results highlight large gaps in the current understanding of the nature of surface geostrophic turbulence.},

  abstract = {This study discusses the upper-ocean (0–200 m) horizontal wavenumber spectra in the Drake Passage from 13 yr of shipboard ADCP measurements, altimeter data, and a high-resolution numerical simulation. At scales between 10 and 200 km, the ADCP kinetic energy spectra approximately follow a k23 power law. The observed ﬂows are more energetic at the surface, but the shape of the kinetic energy spectra is independent of depth. These characteristics resemble predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The ratio of across-track to along-track kinetic energy spectra, however, signiﬁcantly departs from the expectation of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The inconsistency is dramatic at scales smaller than 40 km. A Helmholtz decomposition of the ADCP spectra and analyses of synthetic and numerical model data show that horizontally divergent, ageostrophic ﬂows account for the discrepancy between the observed spectra and predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. In Drake Passage, ageostrophic motions appear to be dominated by inertia–gravity waves and account for about half of the near-surface kinetic energy at scales between 10 and 40 km. Model results indicate that ageostrophic ﬂows imprint on the sea surface, accounting for about half of the sea surface height variance between 10 and 40 km.},

Near the edge of the core regions of high eddy energy, agreement is observed with the prediction of the surface quasigeostrophic (SQG) turbulence theory, which has fundamental differences from that of the traditional quasigeostrophic (QG) turbulence theory. In the core regions of high eddy energy, the spectra are consistent with frontogenesis that is not fully accounted for by the SQG theory. However, the observations in the vast ocean interior of low eddy energy exhibit substantial differences from the predictions of existing theories of oceanic mesoscale turbulence. The spectra in these regions may reﬂect the ocean’s response to short-scale atmospheric forcing and air–sea interaction. The observations presented in this paper serve as a test bed for new theories and ocean general circulation models.},

  abstract = {An eddy-permitting global ocean model is used to interpret kinematics within the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, from 160°E to the coast of America. Because of high levels of variability in this region, observational studies of meridional flow are contradictory, in particular as to whether the net flow is northward or southward. Unlike most oceanographic datasets, model output can be analyzed at high temporal and spatial resolution, providing clues as to real ocean behavior. In the model, a net southward flow occurs across the equator east of 160°W, at most density layers throughout the year. In the central Pacific, from 160°E to 160°W, the net flow is northward but varies with season and occurs primarily in the mixed layer. This is a key region for the flow of Equatorial Undercurrent water into the Northern Hemisphere. The three-dimensional flow is very complex and seasonally dependent. It is vital that these flows are analyzed in an isopycnal framework, or else the pathways are very misleading. In the first half of the year, evidence is found of meridional tropical cells on either side of the equator out to Ϯ5°. These cells appear to exist without any need for diapycnal downwelling. In the second half of the year, when tropical instability waves are active, the cells are overlaid by a strong surface southward flow that appears to be a bolus-type transport. This transport is not apparent unless the flow is calculated in the aforementioned manner.},

  abstract = {A numerical model of the tropical Pacific Ocean is used to investigate the processes that cause the horizontal temperature advection of tropical instability waves (TIWs). It is found that their temperature advection cannot be explained by the processes on which the mixing length paradigm is based. Horizontal mixing of temperature across the equatorial SST front does happen, but it is small relative to the “oscillatory” temperature advection of TIWs. The basic mechanism is that TIWs move water back and forth across a patch of large vertical entrainment. Outside this patch, the atmosphere heats the water and this heat is then transferred into the thermocline inside the patch. These patches of strong localized entrainment are due to equatorial Ekman divergence and due to thinning of the mixed layer in the TIW cyclones. The latter process is responsible for the zonal temperature advection, which is as large as the meridional temperature advection but has not yet been observed. Thus, in the previous observational literature the TIW contribution to the mixed layer heat budget may have been underestimated significantly.},

  abstract = {Brown et al. analyzed the kinematics of flow in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, along time-varying isopycnals in a three-dimensional eddy-permitting model. Here the dynamics of these flows is explored in the same model via the zonal momentum equation (ZME). Previous work has shown that the dominant terms of the ZME, on and near the equator, are the pressure gradient, wind stress, and Coriolis term. In one model study, the nonlinear and friction terms were significant but negated each other. In this study, with a higher-resolution model and more realistic friction scheme it is shown that the nonlinear term is important along and north of the equator, while the explicit friction term is negligible. The part of the nonlinear term derived from high-frequency eddy flows acts like a friction on the Equatorial Undercurrent, while the remaining part of the nonlinear term from smooth flows enhances it. In density coordinates, meridional tropical cells lie on either side of the equator in the first half of the year (January–June) as expected. In July–December, a continuous southward surface flow appears from 4°N into the Southern Hemisphere and arises from variations in the geostrophic flow and the nonlinear term. Variations in the geostrophic flow are due to both seasonal variability in the thermocline and a surface bolus effect arising from baroclinic instability. The nonlinear term increases in the surface layers at the same time assisting the southward flow, most likely because of tropical instability waves.},

The model representation for the mesoscale eddy-induced circulation is the parameterization by Gent and McWilliams, and there are also rectiﬁed contributions to the time-mean overturning circulation due to seasonal and interannual ﬂuctuations. The eddy-induced circulation is similar in all tropical basins. It has a strength of about 10\% of the Eulerian (mainly Ekman) circulation, and its contribution to the meridional heat ﬂux is a similar fraction. The pattern of the meridional streamfunction is one of double cells in the vertical and antisymmetry about the equator. Near the equator there is downwelling above the undercurrent and upwelling below, with the return circulations closed within the upper 250 m and Ϯ5Њ latitude. Away from the equator in each basin, there are overturning cells with ﬂow in the opposite directions to those nearest the equator, which reach deeper into and through the main pycnocline as well as poleward into the subtropics. Similar to the wind-driven Eulerian Meridional Overturning Circulation, the seasonal cycle in the eddy-induced circulation has a magnitude comparable to the time-mean circulation, although for an entirely different dynamical reason associated with seasonal changes in the buoyancy ﬁeld that are primarily diabatic. There is also a circulation anomaly during the 1997/98 El Nin˜o–Southern Oscillation event that nearly cancels the time-mean, counterrotating, eddy-induced cells nearest the equator and surface. The rather good agreement between the measurements and the model solution gives support to the theory underlying the parameterization of eddy-induced circulation, and it indicates that the associated eddy transport coefﬁcients are larger in the Tropics (i.e., ϳ2 ϫ 103 m2 sϪ1) than in middle and high latitudes.},

  abstract = {A numerical simulation is used to investigate the mixed layer heat balance of the tropical Pacific Ocean including the equatorial cold tongue and the region of vortices associated with tropical instability waves (TIWs). The study is motivated by a need to quantify the effects that TIWs have on the climatological heat budget of the cold tongue mixed layer; there has been some discrepancy between observations indicating very large equatorward heat transport by TIWs and models that disagree on the full three-dimensional budget. Validation of the model reveals that the TIW-induced circulation patterns are realistic but may have amplitudes about 15\% weaker than those in the observations. The SST budget within tropical instabilities is first examined in a frame of reference moving with the associated tropical instability vortices (TIVs). Zonal advection of temperature anomalies and meridional advection of temperature by current anomalies dominate horizontal advection. These effects strongly heat the cold cusps and slightly cool the downwelling areas located at the leading edge of the vortices. Cooling by vertical mixing is structured at the vortex scale and almost compensates for horizontal advective heating in the cold cusps. In contrast to some previous studies, TIW-induced vertical advection is found to be negligible in the SST budget. Cooling by this term is only significant below the mixed layer. The effect of TIWs on the climatological heat budget is then investigated for the region bounded by 2°S–6°N, 160°–90°W, where instabilities are most active. TIWinduced horizontal advection leads to a warming of 0.84°C monthϪ1, which is of the same order as the 0.77°C monthϪ1 warming effect of atmospheric fluxes, while the mean currents and vertical mixing cool the upper ocean by Ϫ0.59°C monthϪ1 and Ϫ1.06°C monthϪ1, respectively. The cooling effect of TIW-induced vertical advection is also negligible in the long-term surface layer heat budget and only becomes significant below the mixed layer. The results above, and in particular the absence of cancellation between horizontal and vertical TIW-induced eddy advection, are robust in three other sensitivity experiments involving different mixing parameterizations and increased vertical resolution.},

  abstract = {Tropical instability vortices (TIVs) in the equatorial Paciﬁc exhibit energetic horizontal and vertical circulation characterized by regions of high Rossby number and low Richardson number. Their strong anticyclonic vorticity and vertical shear can inﬂuence the broader-scale circulation by driving lateral mixing and vertical exchange between the ocean surface and interior. The authors use a set of nested high-resolution simulations of the equatorial Paciﬁc, with a ﬁnest grid size of 3 km, to examine the vortex dynamics associated with TIV core water formation. TIV cores are characterized by low values of the Ertel potential vorticity (PV) as the relative vorticity is anticyclonic with magnitude comparable to the local Coriolis parameter. A study of the variation of PV and other scalars along Lagrangian ﬂuid parcel tracks entering the TIVs shows that the low-PV water in their cores is a mix of Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) water and North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC) water. The EUC water is characterized by strong horizontal vorticity, and thus, the baroclinic component of the PV is nonnegligible and acts as a source for the anticyclonic vorticity of TIVs. This horizontal vorticity is tilted by an ageostrophic secondary circulation associated with strain-induced frontogenesis that tends to form along the path of the EUC water that enters the vortex. Frontogenesis disrupts the cyclogeostrophic balance of the frontal ﬂow and drives differential vertical motions across the front. These results emphasize the role of submesoscale physics in the equatorial region, which are active when both the Rossby and Richardson numbers are O(1).},

A regional ocean model is used to investigate the mechanisms through which large-scale TIW circulation modulates the small-scale shear, stratiﬁcation, and shear-driven turbulence in the EUC. Eulerian analyses of time series taken from both the model and the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) array suggest that increases in the zonal shear of the EUC drive increased mixing on the leading edge of the TIW warm phase. A Lagrangian vorticity analysis attributes this increased zonal shear to horizontal vortex stretching driven by the strain in the TIW horizontal velocity ﬁeld acting on the existing EUC shear. To investigate the impact of horizontal vortex stretching on the turbulent heat ﬂux averaged over a TIW period the effects of periodic TIW strain are included as forcing in a simple 1D mixing model of the EUC. Model runs with TIW forcing show turbulent heat ﬂuxes up to 30\% larger than runs without TIW forcing, with the magnitude of the increase being sensitive to the vertical mixing scheme used in the model. These results emphasize the importance of coupling between the large-scale circulation and small-scale turbulence in the equatorial regions, with implications for the SST budget of the equatorial Paciﬁc.},

  abstract = {Submesoscale dynamics in tropical instability waves (TIWs) of the Paciﬁc ocean are analyzed from nested numerical simulations of increasing resolution (36 km, 12 km, and 4 km). It is shown that numerical convergence, as determined by an invariance of the kinetic energy (KE) spectrum with resolution, can be obtained for grid spacing around 10 km. This ﬁnding contrasts with mid-latitude simulations of submesoscale processes that do not converge even for grid spacing less than 1 km. The difference is associated with the larger Rossby radius of deformation at low latitudes due to the weaker Coriolis parameter. For the same reason, the mixed layer Rossby radius is larger as well, resulting in submesoscale mixed layer eddies (MLEs) with scales of 50–200 km. Similar to MLEs at mid-latitudes, those eddies that form at TIW fronts restratify the mixed layer by releasing available potential energy. They lead to an additional source of KE at submesoscale that is larger in the ﬁner resolution simulations. At wavelengths smaller than the mesoscale peak of KE injection, a forward cascade of KE is evident in the simulations where three dynamical ranges are observed: a quasi-inertial range of slope kÀ2, a pre-dissipation range and a far-dissipation range. Numerical dissipation is evaluated and signiﬁcant dissipation is found to occur in a predissipation range, i.e., for wavenumbers well below the range where the KE spectrum tails off exponentially.},

  issn = {21699275},
  abstract = {Our understanding of ocean mixing is challenged by its patchy, episodic nature and a scarcity of direct measurements, especially in the Arctic Ocean. In this study, we exploit a historical record of nearly 3,000 conductivity-temperature-depth proﬁles collected in the shelf and shelf-slope waters of the Canadian Arctic Ocean from 2002 to 2016 to characterize the variability of 28,872 internal wave-driven turbulent dissipation and mixing rate estimates from a ﬁnescale parameterization. We ﬁnd that these estimates of wave-driven dissipation rates and associated diapycnal diﬀusivities are generally low, but exhibit wide variability, each spanning several orders of magnitude. We further ﬁnd that stratiﬁcation plays a signiﬁcant role in modulating the mixing rate both vertically and regionally within the study domain. Dissipation rate and diﬀusivity estimates display a weak seasonal cycle, but no evidence of statistically signiﬁcant interannual trends over this period. Exceptionally large localized temporal variability appears to dominate other potential underlying patterns. The presence of strong upper ocean stratiﬁcation combined with predominately weak dissipation rate estimates implies that many regions in the Canadian Arctic Ocean are likely in a molecular or buoyancy-controlled mixing regime. Even when the concept of a turbulent-enhanced diﬀusivity is potentially relevant, most turbulent heat ﬂux estimates out of the Atlantic Water thermocline are smaller than the average value required to close the standardly assumed Arctic Ocean heat budget. In contrast, we ﬁnd evidence for isolated occurrences of anomalously large heat ﬂuxes, which may disproportionately contribute to the liberation of Atlantic Water heat toward the surface sea ice pack.},

Below the pycnocline, Kρ increased exponentially in the bottom 200 m, reaching 1 × 10− 4 m2 s− 1 a few meters above the bottom. Near-bottom mixing was most intense where the bottom slope equaled the characteristic slope of the semi-diurnal internal tide. This suggests internal wave scattering and/or generation at the bottom, a conclusion supported by near-bottom dissipation rates increasing following rising winds and with intensifying internal waves. Several pinnacles on the slope were local mixing hotspots. Signatures included a vertical line of strong mixing in a pinnacle's wake, an hydraulic jump or lee wave over a downstream side of the summit, and a ‘beam’ sloping upward at the near-inertial characteristic slope. Because dissipation rate averages were dominated by strong turbulence,  /νN2 N 100, the effect on Kρ of alternate mixing efﬁciencies proposed for this range of turbulent intensity is explored.},

In boreal spring, the thermocline and EUC shoal and turbulence decreases. Marginal instability (clustering of the local gradient Richardson number around the critical value of 1/4), evident throughout the rest of the year, has not been detected during spring. While the daily averaged turbulent energy dissipation in the EUC is weakest during the spring, it is not clear whether the diurnal ﬂuctuations that deﬁne the deep cycle cease. Large-eddy simulations are performed using climatological initial and boundary conditions representative of January, April, July, and October. Deep cycle turbulence is evident in all cases; the mechanism remains the same, and the maximum turbulence levels are similar. In the April simulation, however, the deep cycle is conﬁned to the uppermost ;30 m, explaining why it has not been detected in moored microstructure observations.},

  abstract = {Especially in high Reynolds number, naturally-occurring ﬂows, turbulence is a highly variable process. It is challenging to measure yet it is vital that we do so in order to quantify the internal transports of mass, nutrients, energy and momentum. Isolated turbulence proﬁles are difﬁcult to interpret; systematic sampling and subsequent averaging are necessary. Conﬁdence in our ability to properly sample turbulence arises from intergroup comparisons, comparisons with other methods to assess mixing coefﬁcients and, most fundamentally, the constraints imposed by the governing ﬂuid dynamics on both energy losses via viscous dissipation caused by turbulence and on the mixing that results from turbulence. Several examples in which ﬂuid processes have been isolated from the full range of oceanic motions are reviewed in this light. These examples show how observationally-derived estimates of turbulence dissipation or mixing are consistent with larger scale constraints. The larger oceanographic problem of deﬁning the full geographic variability of mixing remains.},

  abstract = {A technique is presented to derive the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy   by using the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to ﬁt a theoretical or known empirical model to turbulence shear spectral observations. The commonly used integration method relies on integrating the shear spectra in the viscous range, thus requiring the resolution of the highest wavenumbers of the turbulence shear spectrum. With current technology, the viscous range is not resolved at sufﬁciently large wavenumbers to estimate high  ; however, long inertial subranges can be resolved, making spectral ﬁtting over both this subrange and the resolved portion of the viscous range an attractive method for deriving  . The MLE takes into account the chidistributed properties of the spectral observations, and so it does not rely on the log-transformed spectral observations. This ﬁtting technique can thus take advantage of both the inertial and viscous subranges, a portion of both, or simply one of the subranges. This ﬂexibility allows a broad range of   to be resolved. The estimated   is insensitive to the range of wavenumbers ﬁtted with the model, provided the noise-dominated portion of the spectra and the low wavenumbers impacted by the mean ﬂow are avoided. For   \& 1026 W kg21, the MLE ﬁtting estimates agree with those obtained by integrating the spectral observations. However, with increasing   the viscous subrange is not fully resolved and the integration method progressively starts to underestimate   compared with the values obtained from ﬁtting the spectral observations.},

  abstract = {Estimating the diapycnal mixing rate from standard CTD data by identifying overturning regions in the water column (the Thorpe-scale approach) provides good spatial and temporal coverage but is sometimes limited by instrument noise. This noise leads to spurious density inversions that are difﬁcult to distinguish from real turbulent overturns. Previous efforts to eliminate noise may have overcorrected and hence underestimated the level of mixing. Here idealized density proﬁles are used to identify the magnitude and characteristics of overturning regions arising entirely from instrument noise, in order to establish a standard against which CTD data can be compared. The key nondimensional parameters are 1) the amplitude of the noise scaled by the density change over the section of proﬁle considered, and 2) the number of data points in the section of proﬁle. In some cases the product of these, which is equal to the amplitude of the noise scaled by the average density difference between consecutive measurements, is more useful than the second parameter. The probability distribution of ‘‘run length,’’ a useful diagnostic, varies signiﬁcantly across this parameter space. Reasons for this are discussed, and it is shown that CTD data very rarely lie in a region of parameter space where comparison with the probability density function (PDF) of run lengths for a random uncorrelated series, or its rms value ͙6, is appropriate. The distribution of Thorpe displacements arising entirely from instrument noise, as well as the Thorpe scale and the statistics of density inversions, is also discussed. Analysis of CTD data from the interfaces of the thermohaline staircase in the deep Canada Basin illustrates how the results can be applied in practice to help to distinguish between signal and noise in marginal regimes. Density inversions seen in these data are shown to be no different from those that would result from instrument noise.},

  abstract = {CTD measurements taken as an integral part of oceanographic cruises could provide valuable information on spatial locations and time variability of significant shear-generated mixing in the ocean interior if used routinely to calculate Thorpe scales, that is, estimates of the scales of vertical overturning in an otherwise stably stratified fluid. This paper outlines methods for calculating reliable Thorpe scales from density profiles taken with a shipborne CTD, including removal of questionable instabilities associated with termination of pressure reversals, reduction of the effects of density noise by computation of an intermediate density profile, and overturn verification by a two-parameter (Ro, ⌬N) diagnostic. The Ro criterion alone reliably removes overturns that result from salinity spikes at the high gradient boundaries of a weakly stratified layer, a common cause of highly suspect overturns. The ⌬N diagnostic is a new water mass test describing the degree of “tightness” of the temperature–salinity (T–S) relationship. The present twoparameter diagnostic rejects a significantly larger percentage of suspect overturns than does a previous single-parameter water mass test. Despite developing a more reliable water mass diagnostic, the authors conclude that rejection of overturns based on a water mass test that incorporates expectation of T–S tightness is not warranted, given possibilities of T–S “looseness” resulting from mixing over regions of nonlinear T–S structure and/or from potential effects of differential diffusion.},

  abstract = {Eddy activity in the four major eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUS) is investigated using 15 years of satellite altimetry data. Based on the analysis of more than 4000 long-lived eddy trajectories in every EBUS, we show that mesoscale structures are mainly generated along the continental coasts and south of the main archipelagos and propagate westward with velocities increasing toward the equator. These mesoscale eddies, having radii of 70–160 km, are then frequently observed along the coastal transition zones and frontal regions and some large oceanic areas are preferentially populated by cyclonic or anticyclonic eddies. Temporal variations of the number of newly-formed eddies and the associated eddy activity index, deﬁned as the mean eddy energy density, are ﬁnally examined at seasonal and interannual scales. The strongest seasonal (interannual, respectively) variations are observed in the California (Benguela) upwelling systems. The proposed indices also exhibit contrasted long-term trends in each EBUS, which suggests that eddy activity might be sensitive to a warming climate.},

  abstract = {Six subtropical salinity maxima (Smax) exist: two each in the Paciﬁc, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean basins. The north Indian (NI) Smax lies in the Arabian Sea while the remaining ﬁve lie in the open ocean. The annual cycle of evaporation minus precipitation (E 2 P) ﬂux over the Smax is asymmetric about the equator. Over the Northern Hemisphere Smax, the semiannual harmonic is dominant (peaking in local summer and winter), while over the Southern Hemisphere Smax, the annual harmonic is dominant (peaking in local winter). Regardless, the surface layer salinity for all six Smax reaches a maximum in local fall and minimum in local spring. This study uses a multidecade integration of an eddy-resolving ocean circulation model to compute salinity budgets for each of the six Smax. The NI Smax budget is dominated by eddy advection related to the evolution of the seasonal monsoon. The ﬁve open-ocean Smax budgets reveal a common annual cycle of vertical diffusive ﬂuxes that peak in winter. These Smax have regions on their eastward and poleward edges in which the vertical salinity gradient is destabilizing. These destabilizing gradients, in conjunction with wintertime surface cooling, generate a gradually deepening wintertime mixed layer. The vertical salinity gradient sharpens at the base of the mixed layer, making the water column susceptible to salt ﬁnger convection and enhancing vertical diffusive salinity ﬂuxes out of the Smax into the ocean interior. This process is also observed in Argo ﬂoat proﬁles and is related to the formation regions of subtropical mode waters.},

  volume = {9},
  issn = {2072-4292},
  abstract = {The primary measure of the quality of sea surface temperature (SST) ﬁelds obtained from satellite-borne infrared sensors has been the bias and variance of matchups with co-located in-situ values. Because such matchups tend to be widely separated, these bias and variance estimates are not necessarily a good measure of small scale (several pixels) gradients in these ﬁelds because one of the primary contributors to the uncertainty in satellite retrievals is atmospheric contamination, which tends to have large spatial scales compared with the pixel separation of infrared sensors. Hence, there is not a good measure to use in selecting SST ﬁelds appropriate for the study of submesoscale processes and, in particular, of processes associated with near-surface fronts, both of which have recently seen a rapid increase in interest. In this study, two methods are examined to address this problem, one based on spectra of the SST data and the other on their variograms. To evaluate the methods, instrument noise was estimated in Level-2 Visible-Infrared Imager-Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) SST ﬁelds of the Sargasso Sea. The two methods provided very nearly identical results for AVHRR: along-scan values of approximately 0.18 K for both day and night and along-track values of 0.21 K for day and night. By contrast, the instrument noise estimated for VIIRS varied by method, scan geometry and day-night. Speciﬁcally, daytime, along-scan (along-track), spectral estimates were found to be approximately 0.05 K (0.08 K) and the corresponding nighttime values of 0.02 K (0.03 K). Daytime estimates based on the variogram were found to be 0.08 K (0.10 K) with the corresponding nighttime values of 0.04 K (0.06 K). Taken together, AVHRR instrument noise is signiﬁcantly larger than VIIRS instrument noise, along-track noise is larger than along-scan noise and daytime levels are higher than nighttime levels. Given the similarity of results and the less stringent preprocessing requirements, the variogram is the preferred method, although there is a suggestion that this approach overestimates the noise for high quality data in dynamically quiet regions. Finally, simulations of the impact of noise on the determination of SST gradients show that on average the gradient magnitude for typical ocean gradients will be accurately estimated with VIIRS but substantially overestimated with AVHRR.},

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) is used to investigate how turbulence in the wind-driven ocean mixed layer erodes the stratiﬁcation of barrier layers. The model consists of a stratiﬁed Ekman layer that is driven by a surface wind. Simulations at a wide range of N0=f are performed to quantify the effect of turbulence and stratiﬁcation on the entrainment rate. Here, N0 is the buoyancy frequency in the barrier layer and f is the Coriolis parameter. The evolution of the mixed layer follows two stages: a rapid initial deepening and a late-time growth at a consipdeﬃﬃﬃrﬃaﬃﬃbly slower rate. During the ﬁrst stage, the mixed layer thickens to the depth that is proportional to uÃ= fN0 where uÃ is the frictional velocity. During the second stage, the turbulence in the mixed layer continues to deepen further into the barrier layer, and the turbulent length scale is shown to scale with uÃ=N0, independent of f. The late-time entrainment rate E follows the law of E50:035RiÃ21=2 where RiÃ is the Richardson number. The exponent of 21/2 is identical but the coefﬁcient of 0.035 is much smaller relative to the value of 223/2 for the nonrotating boundary layer. Simulations using the KPP model (version applicable to this simple case without additional effects of Langmuir turbulence or surface buoyancy ﬂux) also yield the entrainment scaling of E / RiÃ21=2; however, the proportionality coefﬁcient varies with the stratiﬁcation. The structure of the Ekman current is examined to illustrate the strong effect of stratiﬁcation in the limit of large N0=f .},

As a result of this separation, the two types of motion interact only weakly, and the dynamics can be approximated using balanced models, which ﬁlter out the fast waves completely. The separation is not complete, however: The evolution of well-balanced ﬂows inevitably leads to the excitation of inertia-gravity waves through the process of spontaneous generation. Spontaneous generation has fundamental and practical implications: It limits the validity of balanced models and provides a source of inertia-gravity-wave activity. These two aspects are discussed in this review, which focuses on the small-Rossby-number regime ε 1 corresponding to strong rotation. Theoretical arguments indicate that spontaneous generation is then exponentially small in ε for smooth ﬂows. They are complemented by numerical simulations that identify speciﬁc generation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {While near-inertial waves are known to be generated by atmospheric storms, recent observations in the Kuroshio Front ﬁnd intense near-inertial internal-wave shear along sloping isopycnals, even during calm weather. Recent literature suggests that spontaneous generation of near-inertial waves by frontal instabilities could represent a major sink for the subinertial quasigeostrophic circulation. An unforced three-dimensional 1-km-resolution model, initialized with the observed cross-Kuroshio structure, is used to explore this mechanism. After several weeks, the model exhibits growth of 10–100-km-scale frontal meanders, accompanied by O(10) mW m22 spontaneous generation of near-inertial waves associated with readjustment of submesoscale fronts forced out of balance by mesoscale conﬂuent ﬂows. These waves have properties resembling those in the observations. However, they are reabsorbed into the model Kuroshio Front with no more than 15\% dissipating or radiating away. Thus, spontaneous generation of near-inertial waves represents a redistribution of quasigeostrophic energy rather than a signiﬁcant sink.},

  abstract = {Recent theories, models, and observations have suggested the presence of signiﬁcant spontaneous internal wave generation at density fronts near the ocean surface. Spontaneous generation is the emission of waves by unbalanced, large Rossby number ﬂows in the absence of direct forcing. Here, spontaneous generation is investigated in a zonally reentrant channel model using parameter values typical of the Southern Ocean. The model is carefully equilibrated to obtain a steady-state wave ﬁeld for which a closed energy budget is formulated. There are two main results: First, waves are spontaneously generated at sharp fronts in the top 50 m of the model. The magnitude of the energy ﬂux to the wave ﬁeld at these fronts is comparable to that from other mechanisms of wave generation. Second, the surface-generated wave ﬁeld is ampliﬁed in the model interior through interaction with horizontal density gradients within the main zonal current. The magnitude of the mean-to-wave conversion in the model interior is comparable to recent observational estimates and is the dominant source of wave energy in the model, exceeding the initial spontaneous generation. This second result suggests that internal ampliﬁcation of the wave ﬁeld may contribute to the ocean’s internal wave energy budget at a rate commensurate with known generation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Biologging using Kerguelen Islands’ southern elephant seals (SES; Mirounga leonina) has been widely used to collect environmental parameters of the Southern Ocean. This study evaluates whether raw accelerometer and magnetometer data from biologging of SES can be used to predict above-surface wind conditions and wave period and height. From these sensors, SES behavior during post-dive surfacing time has been modeled with the Euler angles pitch, roll, and yaw. Environmental variables (i.e., wind orientation, wind speed, significant wave height, and mean wave period) have been extracted from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) database, which assimilates satellite images into models to provide high-resolution environmental data. SES behavioral and environmental variables are analyzed together to test two hypotheses: (1) SES behavior is constrained by wind speed and/or direction, and (2) SES can be used as weather buoys to estimate wave parameters. Significant pair-wise correlation relations were observed, for example, between SES heading (i.e., yaw) and wind direction. SES vertical displacement was sufficient to estimate the mean wave period with a root-mean-square error below 2 s. Overall, biologged SES tend to orient their heads with the prevailing wind behind them, and are good ocean surface followers, showing great promise for the use of biologged SES as a proxy to collect reliable information on wind and wave conditions. Conversely, this study also suggests that SES respond to environmental conditions to optimize their energy recovery during post-dive surfacing time.},

  abstract = {Strong variability in sea surface salinity (SSS) in the Eastern Tropical Paciﬁc (ETPac) on intraseasonal to interannual timescales was studied using data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, Soil Moisture Active Passive, and Aquarius satellite missions. A zonal wave number‐frequency spectral analysis of SSS reveals a dominant timescale of 50–180 days and spatial scale of 8°–20° of longitude with a distinct seasonal cycle and interannual variability. This intraseasonal SSS signal is detailed in the study of 19 individual ETPac eddies over 2010–2016 identiﬁed by their sea level anomalies, propagating westward at a speed of about 17 cm/s. ETPac eddies trap and advect water in their core westward up to 40° of longitude away from the coast. The SSS signatures of these eddies, with an average anomaly of 0.5‐pss magnitude difference from ambient values, enable the study of their dynamics and the mixing of their core waters with the surroundings. Three categories of eddies were identiﬁed according to the location where they were ﬁrst tracked: (1) in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, (2) in the Gulf of Papagayo, and (3) in the open ocean near 100°W–12°N. They all traveled westward near 10°N latitude. Category 3 is of particular interest, as eddies seeded in the Gulf of Tehuantepec grew substantially in the vicinity of the Clipperton Fracture Zone rise and in a region where the mean zonal currents have anticyclonic shear. The evolution of the SSS signature associated with the eddies indicates the importance of mixing to their dissipation. Plain Language Summary Large (150–250 km) and slow‐moving (westward 14.5 km/day) eddies formed near the Paciﬁc coasts of Mexico and Costa Rica show anomalies in sea surface salinity. The recent satellite missions (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, Soil Moisture Active Passive, and Aquarius) help us characterize the sea surface salinity signal within the eddies during their entire lifelong journey. We show evidence along the latitude of 10°N that these eddies trap and move waters within their cores with reduced exchanges with outside waters for 1,000 to 2,000 km. Three categories of eddies were established according to the location where they ﬁrst reach detection threshold. Eddies detected in the open ocean are of particular interest, as they are greatly affected (growing rates, timing, and pathways) by the bathymetry of the Clipperton fracture zone (between 5,000 and 2,000 m deep) even though their only reach a few hundred meters of depth.},

  abstract = {Recent decadal sea surface height (SSH) variability across the Equatorial and North Indian Ocean (ENIO, north of 58S) is spatially coherent and related to a reversal in basin-scale, upper-ocean-temperature trends. Analysis of ocean and forcing ﬁelds from a data-assimilating ocean synthesis (ECCOv4) suggests that two equally important mechanisms of wind-driven heat redistribution within the Indian Ocean account for a majority of the decadal variability. The ﬁrst is the Cross-Equatorial Cell (CEC) forced by zonal wind stress curl at the equator. The wind stress curl variability relates to the strength and position of the Mascarene High, which is inﬂuenced by the phase of the Indian Ocean Subtropical Dipole. The second mechanism is deep (700 m) upwelling related to zonal wind stress at the equator that causes deep, crossequatorial overturning due to the unique geometry of the basin. The CEC acts to cool the upper ocean throughout most of the ﬁrst decade of satellite altimetry, while the deep upwelling delays and then ampliﬁes the effect of the CEC on SSH. During the subsequent decade, reversals in the forcing anomalies drive warming of the upper ocean and increasing SSH, with the effect of the deep upwelling leading the CEC.},

  issn = {0169-3298, 1573-0956},
  abstract = {The fact that ocean currents must flow parallel to the coast leads to the dynamics of coastal sea level being quite different from the dynamics in the open ocean. The coastal influence of open-ocean dynamics (dynamics associated with forcing which occurs in deep water, beyond the continental slope) therefore involves a hand-over between the predominantly geostrophic dynamics of the interior ocean and the ageostrophic dynamics which must occur at the coast. An understanding of how this hand-over occurs can be obtained by considering the combined role of coastal trapped waves and bottom friction. We here review understanding of coastal trapped waves, which propagate cyclonically around ocean basins along the continental shelf and slope, at speeds which are fast compared to those of baroclinic planetary waves and currents in the open ocean (excluding the large-scale barotropic mode). We show that this results in coastal sea-level signals on western boundaries which, compared to the nearby open-ocean signals, are spatially smoothed, reduced in amplitude, and displaced along the coast in the direction of propagation of coastal trapped waves. The open-ocean influence on eastern boundaries is limited to signals propagating polewards from the equatorial waveguide (although a large-scale diffusive influence may also play a role). This body of work is based on linearised equations, but we also discuss the nonlinear case. We suggest that a proper consideration of nonlinear terms may be very important on western boundaries, as the competition between advection by western boundary currents and a counter-propagating influence of coastal trapped waves has the potential to lead to sharp gradients in coastal sea level where the two effects come into balance.},

As the winds strengthened, upper-ocean mixing due to enhanced vertical shear of storm-generated currents led to a rapid increase of near-surface salinity. Sea surface temperature (SST) cooled very little, however, because the prestorm subsurface ocean was warm. Aquarius SSS increased by 1.5–3 psu over an area of nearly one million square kilometers in the north Bay of Bengal. A one-dimensional model, with initial conditions and surface forcing based on moored observations, shows that cyclone winds rapidly eroded the shallow, salinity-dominated density stratiﬁcation and mixed the upper ocean to 40–50-m depth, consistent with observations. Model sensitivity experiments indicate that changes in ocean mixed layer temperature in response to Cyclone Phailin are small. A nearly isothermal, salinity-stratiﬁed barrier layer in the prestorm upper ocean has two effects. First, near-surface density stratiﬁcation reduces the depth of vertical mixing. Second, mixing is conﬁned to the nearly isothermal layer, resulting in little or no SST cooling.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the impact of salinity stratiﬁcation on the upper-ocean response to a category 5 tropical cyclone, Phailin, that crossed the northern Bay of Bengal (BOB) from 8 to 13 October 2013. A drastic increase of up to 5.0 psu in sea surface salinity (SSS) was observed after Phailin’s passage, whereas a weak drop of below 0.58C was observed in sea surface temperature (SST). Rightward biases were apparent in surface current and SSS but not evident in SST. Phailin-induced SST variations can be divided into the warming and cooling stages, corresponding to the existence of the thick barrier layer (BL) and temperature inversion before and erosion after Phailin’s passage, respectively. During the warming stage, SST increased due to strong entrainment of warmer water from the BL, which overcame the cooling induced by surface heat ﬂuxes and horizontal advection. During the cooling stage, the entrainment and upwelling dominated the SST decrease. The preexistence of the BL, which reduced entrainment cooling by ;1.098C day21, signiﬁcantly weakened the overall Phailin-induced SST cooling. The Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) experiments conﬁrm the crucial roles of entrainment and upwelling in the Phailin-induced dramatic SSS increase and weak SST decrease. Analyses of upper-ocean stratiﬁcation associated with 16 super TCs that occurred in the BOB during 1980–2015 show that intensiﬁcations of 13 TCs were associated with a thick isothermal layer, and 5 out of the 13 were associated with a thick BL. The calculation of TC intensity with and without considering subsurface temperature demonstrates the importance of large upper-ocean heat storage in TC growth.},

  issn = {0022-3670, 1520-0485},
  abstract = {The forcing of the equatorial Indian Ocean by the highly periodic monsoon wind cycle creates many interesting intraseasonal variabilities. The frequency spectrum of the wind stress observations from the European Remote Sensing Satellite scatterometers reveals peaks at the seasonal cycle and its higher harmonics at 180, 120, 90, and 75 days. The observations of sea surface height (SSH) from the Jason and Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon radar altimeters are analyzed to study the ocean’s response. The focus of the study is on the intraseasonal periods shorter than the annual period. The semiannual SSH variability is characterized by a basin mode involving Rossby waves and Kelvin waves traveling back and forth in the equatorial Indian Ocean between 10°S and 10°N. However, the interference of these waves with each other masks the appearance of individual Kelvin and Rossby waves, leading to a nodal point (amphidrome) of phase propagation on the equator at the center of the basin. The characteristics of the mode correspond to a resonance of the basin according to theoretical models. For the semiannual period and the size of the basin, the resonance involves the second baroclinic vertical mode of the ocean. The theory also calls for similar modes at 90 and 60 days. These modes are found only in the eastern part of the basin, where the wind forcing at these periods is primarily located. The western parts of the theoretical modal patterns are not observed, probably because of the lack of wind forcing. There is also similar SSH variability at 120 and 75 days. The 120-day variability, with spatial patterns resembling the semiannual mode, is close to a resonance involving the first baroclinic vertical mode. The 75-day variability, although not a resonant basin mode in theory, exhibits properties similar to the 60- and 90-day variabilities with energy confined to the eastern basin, where the SSH variability seems in resonance with the local wind forcing. The time it takes an oceanic signal to travel eastward as Kelvin waves from the forcing location along the equator and back as Rossby waves off the equator roughly corresponds to the period of the wind forcing. The SSH variability at 60–90 days is coherent with sea surface temperature (SST) with a near-zero phase difference, showing the effects of the time-varying thermocline depth on SST, which may affect the wind in an ocean–atmosphere coupled process governing the intraseasonal variability.},

  abstract = {Almost all heat reaching the bases of Antarctica’s ice shelves originates from warm Circumpolar Deep Water in the open Southern Ocean. This study quantiﬁes the roles of mean and transient ﬂows in transporting heat across almost the entire Antarctic continental slope and shelf using an ocean/sea ice model run at eddy- and tide-resolving (1/48∘) horizontal resolution. Heat transfer by transient ﬂows is approximately attributed to eddies and tides via a decomposition into time scales shorter than and longer than 1 day, respectively. It is shown that eddies transfer heat across the continental slope (ocean depths greater than 1,500 m), but tides produce a stronger shoreward heat ﬂux across the shelf break (ocean depths between 500 m and 1,000 m). However, the tidal heat ﬂuxes are approximately compensated by mean ﬂows, leaving the eddy heat ﬂux to balance the net shoreward heat transport. The eddy-driven cross-slope overturning circulation is too weak to account for the eddy heat ﬂux. This suggests that isopycnal eddy stirring is the principal mechanism of shoreward heat transport around Antarctica, though likely modulated by tides and surface forcing.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces two methods for dynamically prescribing eddy-induced diffusivity, advection, and viscosity appropriate for primitive equation models with resolutions permitting the forward potential enstrophy cascade of quasi-geostrophic dynamics, such as operational ocean models and highresolution climate models with Oð25Þ km horizontal resolution and ﬁner. Where quasi-geostrophic dynamics fail (e.g., the equator, boundary layers, and deep convection), the method reverts to scalings based on a matched two-dimensional enstrophy cascade. A principle advantage is that these subgrid models are scaleaware, meaning that the model is suitable over a range of grid resolutions: from mesoscale grids that just permit baroclinic instabilities to grids below the submesoscale where ageostrophic effects dominate. Two approaches are presented here using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) techniques adapted for threedimensional rotating, stratiﬁed turbulence. The simpler approach has one nondimensional parameter, K, which has an optimal value near 1. The second approach dynamically optimizes K during simulation using a test ﬁlter. The new methods are tested in an idealized scenario by varying the grid resolution, and their use improves the spectra of potential enstrophy and energy in comparison to extant schemes. The new methods keep the gridscale Reynolds and Pe clet numbers near 1 throughout the domain, which confers robust numerical stability and minimal spurious diapycnal mixing. Although there are no explicit parameters in the dynamic approach, there is strong sensitivity to the choice of test ﬁlter. Designing test ﬁlters for heterogeneous ocean turbulence adds cost and uncertainty, and we ﬁnd the dynamic method does not noticeably improve over setting K 5 1.},

We present the distributions of radium isotopes measured on the 2015 U.S. GEOTRACES transect in the Western Arctic Ocean and combine this data set with historical radium observations in the Chukchi Sea and Canada Basin. The highest activities of radium‐228 were observed in the Transpolar Drift and the Chukchi shelfbreak jet, signaling that these currents are heavily inﬂuenced by interactions with shelf sediments. The ventilation of the halocline with respect to inputs from the Chukchi shelf occurs on time scales of ≤19–23 years. Intermediate water ventilation time scales for the Makarov and Canada Basins were determined to be \textasciitilde{}20 and {$>$}30 years, respectively, while deep water residence times in these basins were on the order of centuries.

  abstract = {A new method for computing the rate at which turbulent mixing builds potential energy in the ocean is described. The traditional approach has focused on the rate of change of the background potential energy associated with an adiabatically leveled state. We argue that when examining mixing events, so-called “Thorpe” sorting yields a useful and local measure of diabatically generated potential energy and exhibits some advantages relative to adiabatic leveling. Among these, the open question about the leveling domain is avoided, the fate of kinetic energy during a mixing event is clearly defined, and the computational load associated with the leveling is relieved. The resultant kinetic energy equation leads to a natural definition of mixing efficiency and turbulent diffusivity in terms of sign definite viscous and diffusive contributions. Applications to 2-D Kelvin Helmholtz instability demonstrate the utility of the procedure. We find an integrated efficiency of ≈ 0.15 for a Prandtl number of 1, and of ≈ 0.08 for a Prandtl number of 10. The larger is comparable to the classical value of 0.2 used frequently by the mixing community and smaller than that found in some recent simulations.},

  abstract = {A new theory of shear instability in a turbulent environment is applied to eight days of velocity and density proﬁles from the upper-equatorial Paciﬁc. This period featured a regular diurnal cycle of surface forcing, together with a clear response in upper-ocean mixing. During the day, a layer of stable stratiﬁcation and shear forms at the surface. During late afternoon and evening, this stratiﬁed shear layer descends, leaving the nocturnal mixing layer above it. Using high-resolution current measurements, the detailed structure of the descending shear layer is seen for the ﬁrst time. Linear stability analysis is conducted using a new method that accounts for the effects of preexisting turbulence on instability growth. Shear instability follows a diurnal cycle linked to the afternoon descent of the surface shear layer. This cycle is revealed only when the effect of turbulence is accounted for in the stability analysis. The cycle of instability leads the diurnal mixing cycle, typically by 2–3 h, consistent with the time needed for instabilities to grow and break. Late at night, the resulting turbulence suppresses further instabilities, lending an asymmetry to the mixing cycle that has not been noticed in previous measurements. Deep cycle mixing is triggered by instabilities formed as the descending shear layer merges with the marginally unstable shear of the Equatorial Undercurrent. In the morning, turbulence decays and the upper ocean restratiﬁes. Wind accelerates the near-surface ﬂow to form a new unstable shear layer, and the cycle begins again.},

  abstract = {The propagation of cyclonic and anticyclonic mesoscale eddies through a wide meridional gap with a crossing western boundary current (WBC) is studied using a 1.5‐layer quasi‐geostrophic ocean circulation model. The results of the numerical experiments suggest that a steady, leaping WBC blocks nearly completely all eddies from propagating westward through the gap. In comparison, both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies propagate westward nearly uninterrupted through the gap if the WBC is in a penetrating state. Interactions of mesoscale eddies with a critical‐state WBC trigger regime transitions of the WBC between leaping and penetrating states, resulting in dramatic changes of the circulation west of the gap. The radiation of the circulation plumes from the gap into the western basin due to the WBC regime transition is found to be independent of the size and the initial location of the perturbing eddy in the eastern basin, provided that the WBC path shift is induced successfully by the eddy. Plain Language Summary The Paciﬁc Ocean exchanges mass and heat with the marginal seas and with the Indian Ocean through the large gaps in its western boundary like the Luzon Strait and the Indonesian seas. This study uses a simple computer model to investigate the nonlinear processes of the water exchange through an idealized barrier gap. The results suggest that when a western boundary current (WBC) ﬂows by the gap along the eastern side of the barrier, the westward movement of mesoscale eddies (ocean swirls at the scales of around 100 km in diameter) through the gap is subject to nonlinear interactions with the WBC. Sometimes, the eddies can induce changes of the WBC path so that opposite anomalies to the approaching eddies are generated in the western basin. The nonlinear theory and the results are important for the understanding of the heat and mass budget of the western Paciﬁc Ocean and of the marginal seas environmental changes, which would otherwise be difﬁcult to explain using the linear theory.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of a stratiﬁed oceanic bottom boundary layer (BBL) over an insulating, sloping surface depend critically on the intersection of density surfaces with the bottom. For an imposed along-slope ﬂow, the cross-slope Ekman transport advects density surfaces and generates a near-bottom geostrophic thermal wind shear that opposes the background ﬂow. A limiting case occurs when a momentum balance is achieved between the Coriolis force and a restoring buoyancy force in response to the displacement of stratiﬁed ﬂuid over the slope: this is known as Ekman arrest. However, the turbulent characteristics that accompany this adjustment have received less attention. We present two estimates to characterize the state of the BBL based on the mixed layer thickness: Ha and HL. The former characterizes the steady Ekman arrested state, and the latter characterizes a relaminarized state. The derivation of HL makes use of a newly deﬁned slope Obukhov length Ls that characterizes the relative importance of shear production and cross-slope buoyancy advection. The value of Ha can be combined with the temporally evolving depth of the mixed layer H to form a nondimensional variable H/Ha that provides a similarity prediction of the BBL evolution across different turbulent regimes. The length scale Ls can also be used to obtain an expression for the wall stress when the BBL relaminarizes. We validate these relationships using output from a suite of three-dimensional large-eddy simulations. We conclude that the BBL reaches the relaminarized state before the steady Ekman arrested state. Calculating H/Ha and H/HL from measurements will provide information on the stage of oceanic BBL development being observed. These diagnostics may also help to improve numerical parameterizations of stratiﬁed BBL dynamics over sloping topography.},

  abstract = {Coherent jets are ubiquitous features of the ocean’s circulation, and their characteristics, such as orientation and energetics, may be inﬂuenced by topography. In this study, the authors introduce a large-scale, topographic slope with an arbitrary orientation into quasigeostrophic, doubly periodic, barotropic and baroclinic systems. In both systems, the ﬂow organizes itself into coherent tilted nonzonal jets that are aligned perpendicular to the barotropic potential vorticity (PV) gradient. In the two-layer system, the upper layer, the lower layer, and the barotropic PV gradients all have different orientations and therefore the jets cross the layer-wise PV gradients. The fact that the jets cross layer-wise PV gradients and the requirement of conservation of PV for ﬂuid parcels together results in the drift of the tilted jets across the domain. Like their zonal counterparts, the tilted jets exhibit strong transport anisotropy. The dynamical response to jet deﬂection is very strong in the two-layer baroclinic case, with eddy energy production increasing by orders of magnitude as the topographic slope becomes more zonal. This increase in eddy energy is also reﬂected in an increase in jet spacing and a reduction in strength of the across-jet transport barriers, shown using an effective diffusivity diagnostic. The dynamics identiﬁed here, while formally valid within the constraints of quasigeostrophic scalings, provide important insight into the sensitive relationship between ﬂow orientation and ﬂow stability in regions with broad topographic slopes.},

  volume = {37},
  issn = {0022-3670, 1520-0485},
  abstract = {Analysis of spectral kinetic energy fluxes in satellite altimetry data has demonstrated that an inverse cascade of kinetic energy is ubiquitous in the ocean. In geostrophic turbulence models, a fully developed inverse cascade results in barotropic eddies with large horizontal scales. However, midocean eddies contain substantial energy in the baroclinic mode and in compact horizontal scales (scales comparable to the deformation radius Ld). This paper examines the possibility that relatively strong bottom friction prevents the oceanic cascade from becoming fully developed. The importance of the vertical structure of friction is demonstrated by contrasting numerical simulations of two-layer quasigeostrophic turbulence forced by a baroclinically unstable mean flow and damped by bottom Ekman friction with turbulence damped by vertically symmetric Ekman friction (equal decay rates in the two layers). “Cascade inequalities” derived from the energy and enstrophy equations are used to interpret the numerical results. In the symmetric system, the inequality formally requires a cascade to large-scale barotropic flow, independent of the stratification. The inequality is less strict when friction is in the bottom layer only, especially when stratification is surface intensified. Accordingly, model runs with surface-intensified stratification and relatively strong bottom friction retain substantial small-scale baroclinic energy. Altimetric data show that the symmetric inequality is violated in the low- and midlatitude ocean, again suggesting the potential impact of the “bottomness” of friction on eddies. Inequalities developed for multilayer turbulence suggest that high baroclinic modes in the mean shear also enhance small-scale baroclinic eddy energy. The inequalities motivate a new interpretation of barotropization in weakly damped turbulence. In that limit the barotropic mode dominates the spatial average of kinetic energy density because large values of barotropic density are found throughout the model domain, consistent with the barotropic cascade to large horizontal scales, while baroclinic density is spatially localized.},

  abstract = {The Tropical Atlantic Current Observations Study measured upper ocean horizontal velocity from a mooring at 4°N, 23°W, at discrete depths between 7 and 87 m, in order to observe the temporal and vertical structure of the currents. Between March 2017 and March 2018, mean zonal velocity and vertical shear were strongest between 32 and 37 m. Near‐surface mean eastward currents during this period were weaker than the long‐term mean but within the range of previously observed values given the high interannual variability. Interannual variability of the zonal velocity exceeded that of the meridional velocity, was primarily geostrophically driven, and was strongly inﬂuenced by the large‐scale currents. Energetic tropical instability waves (TIWs) were observed in early summer and late fall of 2017. Meridional velocity ﬂuctuations associated with the TIWs were far larger than those of zonal velocity and extended down to 87 m. These ﬂuctuations propagated upward to the surface with vertical phase speeds between 12 and 15 m/day. Coherent velocity and vertical shear variations emerged in a TIW composite. However, the vertical shears observed during the TIW season were modest compared to the large shear measured in spring 2017 and winter 2018. As a result, TIWs may be less crucial for vertical turbulent cooling at 4°N, 23°W than they are near the equator. To observe the intense winter/spring vertical shear events, ﬁne vertical (less than 10 m) and diurnal temporal sampling is needed.},

  issn = {0022-3670, 1520-0485},
  abstract = {Climate models suffer from signiﬁcant biases over the tropical Paciﬁc Ocean, including a too-cold cold tongue and too-warm temperature at the depth of the thermocline. The emergence of model biases can be partly attributed to vertical mixing parameterizations, in which there are great uncertainties in selections of functional forms and empirical parameters. In this paper, the impacts of two different vertical mixing schemes on the tropical Paciﬁc temperature simulations are investigated using version 5 of the Modular Ocean Model (MOM5). One vertical mixing scheme is the widely used K-proﬁle parameterization (KPP) scheme, and the other is a hybrid mixing scheme (the Chen scheme) by combining a Kraus–Turner-type bulk mixed layer (ML) model with Peters et al.’s shear instability mixing model (PGT model). It is shown that the Chen scheme works better than the KPP scheme for SST simulation but produces an exaggerated subsurface warm bias simultaneously. The better SST simulation can be attributed to the employment of the PGT model, which produces lower levels of shear instability mixing than its counterpart in the KPP scheme. Furthermore, a modiﬁed KPP scheme is presented in which its shear instability mixing model and constant background diffusivity are replaced by the PGT model and the Argo-derived background diffusivity, respectively. This new scheme is then employed into MOM5-based ocean-only and coupled simulations, demonstrating substantial improvements in temperature simulations over the tropical Paciﬁc. The modiﬁed KPP scheme can be easily employed into other ocean models, offering an effective way to improve ocean simulations.},

Mean meridional currents for the entire longitude range included poleward surface ﬂows reaching Ϫ0.09 m sϪ1 in the south and 0.13 m sϪ1 in the north as well as equatorward ﬂow within the thermocline reaching 0.05 m sϪ1 in the south and Ϫ0.04 m sϪ1 in the north near 23ЊC (85 m).

After longterm integration, the model reaches the equilibrium state in which alternating bands of long-term mean currents are found over the continental shelf. The generation of the band structure is consistent with the observational results obtained by acoustic Doppler current proﬁlers on the shelf of the East China Sea. The western boundary current is accompanied by frontal waves, and so vertical momentum transfer occurs because of the diffusive stretching. Topographic Rossby waves are excited on the shelf slope by the vertical momentum transfer. Thereafter, energy of the waves proceeds to ﬂow toward the lower-frequency limit by resonant interactions. The alongshelf wavenumber also vanishes to satisfy the dispersion relation of the topographic Rossby wave. As a consequence, the alternating bands of mean current are found over the continental shelf.},

Consistent with satellitetracked drifter trajectories, this LCS constitutes a cross-shelf barrier for the lateral transport of passive tracers. Because of the constraints that the above LCS, as well as smaller-scale LCSs lying shoreside, can impose on pollutant dispersal and its potentially very important biological consequences, a study was carried out on the nature of the surface ocean Lagrangian motion on the WFS. The analysis is based on the same simulated surface ocean velocity ﬁeld that has been able to sustain the aforementioned persistent cross-shelf transport barrier. Examination of several diagnostics suggests that chaotic stirring dominates over turbulent mixing on time scales of up to two months or so. More speciﬁcally, it is found on those time scales that tracer evolution at a given length scale is governed to a nonnegligible extent by coarser-scale velocity ﬁeld features, ﬂuid particle dispersion is spatially inhomogeneous, and the Lagrangian evolution is more irregular than the driving Eulerian ﬂow.},

The jets closer to the equator are remarkably zonally coherent across the basin, but the jets farther poleward appear broken in several segments. In the western half of the basin, the 1000-m zonal jets appear to slant slightly poleward from east to west. At the western boundary in the south (east of Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea), the alternating jets appear to connect in narrow boundary currents. Seasonal zonal velocity anomalies at 1000 and 1500 m are observed to propagate westward across the basin; they are consistent with annual vertically propagating Rossby waves superimposed on the mean zonal jets.

  abstract = {Cross-isobath transport of Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW) provides a major source of heat to the Antarctic continental shelves. Adaptive sampling with a Slocum glider revealed that the UCDW regularly intrudes onto the western Antarctic Peninsula shelf within mesoscale eddies, and a linear stability analysis of the shelf-break current upstream conﬁrmed eddy length scales and vertical structure are consistent with the baroclinic instability of the current. The properties of the most unstable mode are insensitive to current orientation but sensitive to bottom slope in accordance with modiﬁed Eady theory. Once on the shelf, the eddies’ core properties mix with ambient shelf water to form modiﬁed CDW (mCDW). Concurrent shipboard CTD and ADCP data are used to diagnose the responsible mixing processes and highlight the importance of thermohaline intrusions. The genesis mechanism of the interleaving layers cannot be conﬁrmed, however a simple analytic model suggests the upper limit contribution of advection by internal waves cannot account for the observed temperature variance unless the cross-eddy temperature gradient is large. Data-adaptive sampling of an eddy with the glider revealed it lost heat across two isopycnals and a ﬁxed radius at a rate of 7 3 109 J s21 over 3.9 days. This rate is corroborated by a diffusion model initialized with the eddy’s initial hydrographic properties and informed by the heat ﬂuxes parameterized from the shipboard data. The results suggest eddies predominately lose heat laterally and downward, which preserves subsurface heat for melting of marine-terminating glaciers.},

  abstract = {A global reference state of the subtropical mode water and permanent pycnocline properties for the 2000–2015 period is presented. The climatology is obtained from a pattern recognition algorithm applied to stratification profiles from the Argo global array. The stratification features are identified as permanent upper ocean pycnostad and pycnocline even when the seasonal pycnocline is developed. The climatology shows that both Northern Hemisphere subtropical gyres have a qualitatively very similar stratification structure. The permanent pycnoclines in the North Atlantic and North Pacific show two deep centers colocated with thick subtropical and subpolar mode waters. These centers coincide with modes in the density and stratification space. These deep pycnocline centers are separated by a region with a shallower and thinner permanent pycnocline that is located downstream of Western Boundary Current Extensions and upstream of Eastern Subtropical Fronts. This feature creates a remarkable double-bowl pattern at the basin scale. In the subtropical gyres of the South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans, the mode water and permanent pycnocline structures are characterized by two modes in the density and stratification space that, unlike in the Northern Hemisphere, do not necessarily correspond to deep and thick permanent pycnocline regions. In the subtropical gyre of the South Indian Ocean, a single mode is found to correspond to a single center in the western part of the gyre. This study also shows that away from these deep centers where the pycnocline depth almost follows isopycnals, the permanent pycnocline experiences significant thermohaline gradients that are not density compensated.},

The main body of extratropical water within the EUC is transported through the western boundary pathways, while the percent transported via the interior pathways gradually increases toward the east. Tropical water merges into the EUC mainly through the tropical cells with a larger portion through the northern side of the equator.},

  abstract = {Twenty Electromagnetic Autonomous Proﬁling Explorer (EM-APEX) ﬂoats in the upper-ocean thermocline of the summer Sargasso Sea observed the temporal and vertical variations of Ertel potential vorticity (PV) at 7–70-m vertical scale, averaged over O(4–8)-km horizontal scale. PV is dominated by its linear components—vertical vorticity and vortex stretching, each with an rms value of ;0.15f. In the internal wave frequency band, they are coherent and in phase, as expected for linear internal waves. Packets of strong, .0.2f, vertical vorticity and vortex stretching balance closely with a small net rms PV. The PV spectrum peaks at the highest resolvable vertical wavenumber, ;0.1 cpm. The PV frequency spectrum has a red spectral shape, a 21 spectral slope in the internal wave frequency band, and a small peak at the inertial frequency. PV measured at near-inertial frequencies is partially attributed to the non-Lagrangian nature of ﬂoat measurements. Measurement errors and the vortical mode also contribute to PV in the internal wave frequency band. The vortical mode Burger number, computed using time rates of change of vertical vorticity and vortex stretching, is 0.2–0.4, implying a horizontal kinetic energy to available potential energy ratio of ;0.1. The vortical mode energy frequency spectrum is 1–2 decades less than the observed energy spectrum. Vortical mode energy is likely underestimated because its energy at vertical scales . 70 m was not measured. The vortical mode to total energy ratio increases with vertical wavenumber, implying its importance at small vertical scales.},

  abstract = {Oceanic boundary currents over the continental slope exhibit variability with a range of time scales. Numerical studies of steady, along-slope currents over a sloping bathymetry have shown that cross-slope Ekman transport can advect buoyancy surfaces in a bottom boundary layer (BBL) so as to produce vertically sheared geostrophic ﬂows that bring the total ﬂow to rest: a process known as buoyancy shutdown of Ekman transport or Ekman arrest. This study considers the generation and evolution of near-bottom ﬂows due to a barotropic, oscillating, and laterally sheared ﬂow over a slope. The sensitivity of the boundary circulation to changes in oscillation frequency v, background ﬂow amplitude, bottom slope, and background stratiﬁcation is explored. When v/f ( 1, where f is the Coriolis frequency, oscillations allow the system to escape from the steady buoyancy shutdown scenario. The BBL is responsible for generating a secondary overturning circulation that produces vertical velocities that, combined with the potential vorticity (PV) anomalies of the imposed barotropic ﬂow, give rise to a time-mean, rectiﬁed, vertical eddy PV ﬂux into the ocean interior: a ‘‘PV pump.’’ In these idealized simulations, the PV anomalies in the BBL make a secondary contribution to the timeaveraged PV ﬂux. Numerical results show the domain-averaged eddy PV ﬂux increases nonlinearly with v with a peak near the inertial frequency, followed by a sharp decay for v/f . 1. Different physical mechanisms are discussed that could give rise to the temporal variability of boundary currents.},

  abstract = {Observations are used to evaluate a simple theoretical model for the generation of near-inertial shear spikes at the base of the open ocean mixed layer when the upper ocean displays a two-layer structure. The model predicts that large changes in shear squared can be produced by the alignment of the wind and shear vectors. A climatology of stratiﬁcation and shear variance in Drake Passage is presented, which shows that these assumptions are most applicable to summer, fall, and spring but are not highly applicable to winter. Temperature, salinity, and velocity data from a high spatial resolution cruise in Drake Passage show that the model does not predict all large changes in shear variance; the model is most effective at predicting changes in shear squared when it arises owing to near-inertial wind-driven currents without requiring a rotating resonant wind stress. The model is also more effective where there is a uniform mixed layer above a strongly stratiﬁed transition layer. Rotary spectral and statistical analysis of an additional 242 Drake Passage transects from 1999 to 2011 conﬁrmed the presence of this shear-spiking mechanism, particularly in summer, spring, and fall when stratiﬁcation is stronger.},

  abstract = {The surface mixed layer of the ocean is often characterized by thermohaline compensation and alignment. That is, temperature and salinity gradients tend to be parallel and to cancel in their contribution to density. In this paper a combination of theoretical arguments and numerical simulations is presented to investigate how compensation and alignment emerge as a result of processes at work within the mixed layer. The dynamics of the mixed layer is investigated through a simple model that couples a nonlinear diffusive parameterization for the horizontal transports of temperature and salinity with stirring by mesoscale eddies. It is found that stirring quickly aligns the temperature and salinity gradients and that nonlinear diffusion creates compensation. Neither process, by itself, is sufﬁcient to reproduce the observations.},

The initial front evolves into fully developed geostrophic turbulence characterized by large Rossby number, strong vortical asymmetry, and kÀ3 eddy kinetic energy and density spectra (k is the horizontal wavenumber). The baroclinic eddies are trapped in the upper 20 m, and their growth is limited by conversion from the eddy to mean kinetic energy. The surface frontogenesis drives vigorous thermohaline intrusions of density-compensated temperature and salinity anomalies. Warmer saltier slope waters are subducted in the wave troughs, while colder fresher shelf waters are upwelled in the wave crests. The model results compare well with the observed distribution of subsurface salinity maxima.

  abstract = {The horizontal density ratio in the upper ocean is examined using SeaSoar data collected over the last 15 years in the Paciﬁc, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. The horizontal density ratio R is deﬁned to be the ratio of the relative effect of temperature and salinity on density. A front with a horizontal density ratio of 1 is said to be compensated since temperature and salinity gradients compensate in their effect on density. The statistics of density ratio are examined through calculation of conditional probability density functions. Case studies from each of the oceans elucidate processes affecting the density ratio. Global distributions of density ratio are calculated as functions of mixed-layer depth, distance below the mixed layer, and magnitude of thermohaline variability. Compensation is found in all oceans, on 3–4 km horizontal scales, when the mixed layer is deep and signiﬁcant thermohaline variability exists. The tendency for compensation is stronger as mixed-layer depth increases. Conversely, compensation is not typical in shallow mixed layers, or when thermohaline variability is weak. The thermocline density ratio is found to be 2, in agreement with previous observational studies, and consistent with the process of salt ﬁngering. The transition from R = 1 in the mixed layer to R = 2 in the thermocline is sharp when the mixed layer is deep. The ubiquity of compensation in the mixed layer is consistent with recent theory that suggests horizontal eddy diffusivity is a growing function of density gradient.},

  abstract = {The Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) is a major component of the tropical Paciﬁc Ocean circulation. EUC velocity in most global climate models is sluggish relative to observations. Insufﬁcient ocean resolution slows the EUC in the eastern Paciﬁc where nonlinear terms should dominate the zonal momentum balance. A slow EUC in the east creates a bottleneck for the EUC to the west. However, this bottleneck does not impair other major components of the tropical circulation, including upwelling and poleward transport. In most models, upwelling velocity and poleward transport divergence fall within directly estimated uncertainties. Both of these transports play a critical role in a theory for how the tropical Paciﬁc may change under increased radiative forcing, that is, the ocean dynamical thermostat mechanism. These ﬁndings suggest that, in the mean, global climate models may not underrepresent the role of equatorial ocean circulation, nor perhaps bias the balance between competing mechanisms for how the tropical Paciﬁc might change in the future. Implications for model improvement under higher resolution are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The NOAA Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) moored array has, for three decades, been a valuable resource for monitoring and forecasting El Niño–Southern Oscillation and understanding physical oceanographic as well as coupled processes in the tropical Paciﬁc inﬂuencing global climate. Acoustic Doppler current proﬁler (ADCP) measurements by TAO moorings provide benchmarks for evaluating numerical simulations of subsurface circulation including the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC). Meanwhile, the Sea Education Association (SEA) has been collecting data during repeat cruises to the central equatorial Paciﬁc Ocean (1608–1268W) throughout the past decade that provide useful cross validation and quantitative insight into the potential for stationary observing platforms such as TAO to incur sampling biases related to the strength of the EUC. This paper describes some essential sampling characteristics of the SEA dataset, compares SEA and TAO velocity measurements in the vicinity of the EUC, shares new insight into EUC characteristics and behavior only observable in repeat cross-equatorial sections, and estimates the sampling bias incurred by equatorial TAO moorings in their estimates of the velocity and transport of the EUC. The SEA high-resolution ADCP dataset compares well with concurrent TAO measurements (RMSE 5 0.05 m s21; R2 5 0.98), suggests that the EUC core meanders sinusoidally about the equator between 60.48 latitude, and reveals a mean sampling bias of equatorial measurements (e.g., TAO) of the EUC’s zonal velocity of 20.14 6 0.03 m s21 as well as a ;10\% underestimation of EUC volume transport. A bias-corrected monthly record and climatology of EUC strength at 1408W for 1990–2010 is presented.},

  volume = {47},
  issn = {00222402, 15439542},
  abstract = {Eddy momentum and heat fluxes are estimated from three-dimensional arrays of long time-series current meter measurements in the equatorial Pacific near 152W and II OW during 1979 to 1981. Eddies transport eastward momentum away from the equator above the core of the Equatorial Undercurrent; they transport eastward momentum toward the equator below the Undercurrent core. The vertical integral of the eddy momentum flux divergence is equivalent to a westward wind stress of 0.16 dyne cm-2. Eddies transport heat toward the equator at all depths down to 250 m. At 100 m depth and below, the eddy heat flux convergences are remarkably similar at 152W and 1l0W. Above 100 m, the heat flux convergence at 1l0W is much larger than that at 152W. The vertical integral of the average eddy heat flux convergence between 152W and 1lOW is equivalent to a heating of the equatorial region at a rate of 245 W m-2• Lateral eddy viscosities and diffusivities are of order 0.5 to 5 x 107 cm2 S-I, similar to those generally used in numerical models. Eddy coefficients, however, are positive only above the core of the Equatorial Undercurrent and are consistently negative below the Undercurrent core. Fluctuations with periods between 32 and 13 days and centered at 21-day period contribute the bulk of the eddy heat and momentum fluxes.},

  abstract = {The Sverdrup circulation in the tropical Paciﬁc is constructed from satellite scatterometer winds, compared with measured ocean currents, and diagnosed in an ocean GCM. Previous depictions of the Sverdrup circulation near the equator have shown only weak vertically integrated ﬂows; here it is shown that the actual transports are not weak. This discrepancy could be due either to inaccuracies in the wind forcing or to Sverdrup dynamics being too simple in this region. Scatterometer winds show a strip of positive curl along the SST front north of the equator in the eastern Paciﬁc that is due to wind speed changes induced by the front. Including that additional element of curl forcing greatly improves the realism of the Sverdrup representation, but the magnitudes of the equatorial transport are still too small by a factor of about 2. Although the nonlinear (advective and friction) terms are small in the model momentum balance, they are O(1) in the vorticity balance, especially because their meridional derivatives are large near the equator. Examining the effect of the nonlinear terms through the vorticity balance shows that advection acts to intensify the mean currents of the tropical Paciﬁc, including both the Equatorial Undercurrent and the westward off-equatorial South Equatorial Current. However, the principal nonlinearity is due to the acceleration and deceleration of the Equatorial Undercurrent, not to meridional convergence as has been previously argued.},

At latitudes higher than 10° the zonal current correlation remains respectable, but OSCAR amplitudes diminish unrealistically. Variability of meridional currents is poorly reproduced, with severely diminished amplitudes and reduced correlations relative to those for zonal velocity on the equator. OSCAR’s RMS differences from drifter velocities are very similar to those experienced by the ECCO (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean) data-assimilating models, but OSCAR generally provides a larger ocean-correlated signal, which enhances its ratio of estimated signal over noise. Several opportunities exist for modest improvements in OSCAR fidelity even with presently available datasets.},

All significantcontributions from the mean, annual cycle, and higher-frequencyflow fields are determinedwith the exceptionof the vertical stresses.We find that even neglecting vertical stresses,the zonal momentum equation is in rough balance at 90-117-m depth at all latitudes from 4øSto 10øN.While the formal error bars are large, this rough balanceis reproducibleover four to five independentlatitudesand so is probably real. The balance at 90-m depth is geostrophicto within 5øof the equator. Closer to the equator, meridional mean convergence and meridional eddy stressescontribute important forces to balance the mean pressure gradient. Nearer the surface, the zonal momentum equation is dominatedby eastward pressuregradientsnear the equator and eastward Coriolis forces from a strong, northward Ekman flow poleward of 2øN. In the vertical integral these forces roughly balance the surfacewind stress;thus vertical stressessufficeto close our momentum budget. We conclude that on average vertical stressesarising from the wind forcing do not penetrate deeper than 90 m into the tropical ocean. This contradicts an earlier study of the equatorial zonal momentum budget but is consistentwith turbulent dissipationmeasurementson the equator. Previous findings of stronger, deeper dissipation on the equator are probably due to the stronger, deeper mean shear there rather than to a locally altered stressprofile. Vertical turbulent viscositiesderived from our observationsagree with previous observationson the equator but contradict the conventional,Richardsonnumber parameterization off the equator.},

  abstract = {Observations have suggested a trend of decreasing dissolved oxygen (DO) and increasing spiciness in summertime middepth slope waters and bottom shelf waters along the United States west coast over the past 50 years, but they have also demonstrated a large amount of interannual and decadal variability. Shelf bottom water and slope water properties can be inﬂuenced by both local and remote effects, including changes in circulation or changes in the characteristics of the source waters supplying the region. A regional-scale, coupled physical biogeochemical model has been developed to simulate seasonal-to-decadal scale variability along the US west coast to discern the physical dynamics behind these spatial and temporal patterns. A simulation run from 1981 to 2006 with forcing that incorporates the larger scale interannual trends reproduces the development of low DO late in the upwelling season, the considerable interannual variability and the reported tendency toward a shoaling, more spicy, and oxygen-depleted, northern California Undercurrent (CU). Whereas the trend in spiciness in the model results from increased inﬂuence of equatorial relative to subarctic source waters, the decreases in DO are found to additionally be a consequence of local biogeochemical processes. In order to better understand the interannual variability, years of the simulation were classiﬁed into four groups based on intensity of upwelling forcing and undercurrent strength. Slope water characteristics, shelf-slope exchange, and slope-basin exchange were compared across the four cases. Years with both strong upwelling and a strong undercurrent generated the most negative anomalies in slope-water DO late in the upwelling season.},

  abstract = {As part of the Warm Core Rings Experiment, a set of intensive observations of thermohaline intrusions at the outer edge of a warm ring were obtained. The observations included a CTD tow-yo, repeated microstructure profiles and continuous acoustic Doppler velocity measurements. The survey was performed relative to the drift of a drogued surface buoy. The CTD data allowed us to map the three-dimensional structure of the intrusive features. The data indicate that the core of a cold, fresh intrusion became lighter as it extended across the front. This is contrary to the usual expectation that such intrusions should get denser under the influence of salt fingers. An explanation for this apparent behavior can be found in the microstructure profiles, which suggest that the diffusive interfaces associated with the intrusion are the dominant mixing process, since they are more strongly unstable and reveal higher turbulence levels than nearby fingering regions. Clear signatures of double-diffusive mixing are seen in the fine- and microstructure data; however, the turbulent dissipation in the diffuswe layers was not as high as the laboratory flux laws predict and shear-driven turbulence may be the stronger mixing mechanism. Double diffusion clearly plays some role in mixing the intrusive features but its role in actually generating the intrusion remains ambiguous, given the tendency of warm-core rings to wrap "streamers" of shelf, slope and Gulf Stream waters around themselves.},

The proposed procedure includes the correction of the slip bias of undrogued drifters, thus recovering about half of the GDP dataset; and a new approach for decomposing Lagrangian data into mean, seasonal and eddy components, which reduces the smoothing of spatial gradients inherent in data binning methods. The sensitivity of the results to method parameters, the method performance relative to other techniques, and the associated estimation errors, are evaluated using statistics calculated for a test dataset consisting of altimeter-derived geostrophic velocities subsampled at the drifter locations, and for the full altimeter-derived geostrophic velocity ﬁelds.},

  abstract = {A systematic development, based on the construction of an asymptotic solution of the Euler equation, written in rotating, spherical coordinates (u, u, r), is used to investigate the ﬂows of the type seen in the neighborhood of the Paciﬁc equator. First, it is shown that the observed poleward surface-ﬂow structure away from the line of the equator is possible only if the ﬂow evolves (changes) in the azimuthal direction. Then, allowing for variations in the azimuthal direction, the shallow-water, small-Rossby-number version of the problem, approximated close to the equator, leads to an asymptotic formulation that admits any prescribed azimuthal velocity proﬁle u(u, r) at some ﬁxed longitude u. The maximum extent of the ﬂow region inside which we can describe in detail the velocity ﬁeld is restricted by the size of the Rossby number. The analysis demonstrates that the meridional y and vertical w velocity components are nonlinearly connected to u, and that all three velocity components appear at the same order in the leading (scaled) equations, even though the physical size of w is very much smaller than that of the other two components. An appropriate choice is made for u, at a given u, and the corresponding complete threedimensional ﬂow ﬁeld, which emerges from the interlinkage of the velocity components, is described; the thermocline is also added to the ﬂow conﬁguration. We compare these results with the available ﬁeld data, demonstrating that this formulation captures all the main structures of the ﬂow ﬁeld, but also allows for many choices to be made that can be used to adjust the details of the ﬂow and to model other, similar ﬂows.},

  abstract = {This volume deals with various nonlinear phenomena in geophysical flows. Processes studied are, among others, the stability of currents and vortices, internal wave generation and propagation, and atmosphere-ocean interaction. The geographic extent of the processes discussed range from the local (the Gulf of California and other marginal seas) to the global (the general oceanic circulation). The studies contained in this volume are based on observations (in situ as well as satellite measurements), theoretical analysis (Hamiltonian fluid dynamics and stability theory), numerical simulations and laboratory experiments.},

  title = {Estimation of the {{Tropical Pacific Ocean State}} 2010–13},
  volume = {34},
  issn = {0739-0572, 1520-0426},
  abstract = {A data-assimilating 1/38 regional dynamical ocean model is evaluated on its ability to synthesize components of the Tropical Paciﬁc Ocean Observing System. The four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) method adjusts initial conditions and atmospheric forcing for overlapping 4-month model runs, or hindcasts, that are then combined to give an ocean state estimate for the period 2010–13. Consistency within uncertainty with satellite SSH and Argo proﬁles is achieved. Comparison to independent observations from Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) moorings shows that for time scales shorter than 100 days, the state estimate improves estimates of TAO temperature relative to an optimally interpolated Argo product. The improvement is greater at time scales shorter than 20 days, although unpredicted variability in the TAO temperatures implies that TAO observations provide signiﬁcant information in that band. Larger discrepancies between the state estimate and independent observations from Spray gliders deployed near the Galápagos, Palau, and Solomon Islands are attributed to insufﬁcient model resolution to capture the dynamics in strong current regions and near coasts. The sea surface height forecast skill of the model is assessed. Model forecasts using climatological forcing and boundary conditions are more skillful than climatology out to 50 days compared to persistence, which is a more skillful forecast than climatology out to approximately 20 days. Hindcasts using reanalysis products for atmospheric forcing and open boundary conditions are more skillful than climatology for approximately 120 days or longer, with the exact time scale depending on the accuracy of the state estimate used for initializing and on the reanalysis forcing. Estimating the model representational error is a goal of these experiments.},

  abstract = {Oxygen levels within the oxygen deﬁcient zone (ODZ) of the Bay of Bengal are mapped using 11 ARGO ﬂoats spanning 5 years. North of about 18°N in the ODZ ‘core’, minimum oxygen levels are uniformly below \textasciitilde{}1 μmol kg−1. South of this, in the ODZ ‘edge’, oxygen levels increase toward an average of about 7 μmol kg−1 at 10°N, but with high variability so that values below \textasciitilde{}1 μmol kg−1 occur at all latitudes. This variability is consistent with simple models of mesoscale eddy stirring which suggest an exchange time for the core of about 1 year. Existing measurements of microbial transformation of nitrate to N2 in the Bay of Bengal have only been made in the edge region and may underestimate rates in the core region with lowest O2 concentration and thus the overall N transformation rates in this ODZ.},
